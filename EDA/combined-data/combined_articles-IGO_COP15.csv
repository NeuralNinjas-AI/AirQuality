IPCC-2007-1.txt,"A report of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  Introduction The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report describes progress in understanding of the human and natural drivers of climate change,1 observed climate change, climate processes and attribution, and estimates of projected future climate change. It builds upon past IPCC assessments and incorporates new findings from the past six years of research. Scientific progress since the Third Assessment Report (TAR) is based upon large amounts of new and more comprehensive data, more sophisticated analyses of data, improvements in understanding of processes and their simulation in models and more extensive exploration of uncertainty ranges. The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections specified in curly brackets. Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change Changes in the atmospheric abundance of greenhouse gases and aerosols, in solar radiation and in land surface properties alter the energy balance of the climate system. These changes are expressed in terms of radiative forcing,2 which is used to compare how a range of human and natural factors drive warming or cooling influences on global climate. Since the TAR, new observations and related modelling of greenhouse gases, solar activity, land surface properties and some aspects of aerosols have led to improvements in the quantitative estimates of radiative forcing.  Global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have increased markedly as a result of human activities since 1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values determined from ice cores spanning many thousands of years (see Figure SPM.1). The global increases in carbon dioxide concentration are due primarily to fossil fuel use and land use change, while those of methane and nitrous oxide are primarily due to agriculture. {2.3, 6.4, 7.3} - Carbon dioxide is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas (see Figure SPM.2). The global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm3 in 2005. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores. The annual carbon dioxide concentration growth rate was larger during the last 10 years (1995-2005 average: 1.9 ppm per year), than it has been since the beginning of continuous direct atmospheric measurements (1960-2005 average: 1.4 ppm per year) although there is year-to-year variability in growth rates. {2.3, 7.3} - The primary source of the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide since the pre-industrial period results from fossil fuel use, with land-use change providing another significant but smaller contribution. Annual fossil carbon dioxide emissions4 increased from an average of 6.4 [6.0 to 6.8]5 GtC (23.5 [22.0 to 25.0] GtCO2) per year in the 1990s to 7.2 [6.9 to 7.5] GtC (26.4 [25.3 to 27.5] GtCO2) per year in 2000-2005 (2004 and 2005 data are interim estimates). Carbon dioxide emissions associated with land-use change  CHANGES IN GREENHOUSE GASES FROM ICE CORE AND MODERN DATA  are estimated to be 1.6 [0.5 to 2.7] GtC (5.9 [1.8 to 9.9] GtCO2) per year over the 1990s, although these estimates have a large uncertainty. {7.3} - The global atmospheric concentration of methane has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 715 ppb to 1732 ppb in the early 1990s, and was 1774 ppb in 2005. The atmospheric concentration of methane in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range of the last 650,000 years (320 to 790 ppb) as determined from ice cores. Growth rates have declined since the early 1990s, consistent with total emissions (sum of anthropogenic and natural sources) being nearly constant during this period. It is very likely6 that the observed increase in methane concentration is due to anthropogenic activities, predominantly agriculture and fossil fuel use, but relative contributions from different source types are not well determined. {2.3, 7.4} - The global atmospheric nitrous oxide concentration increased from a pre-industrial value of about 270 ppb to 319 ppb in 2005. The growth rate has been approximately constant since 1980. More than a third of all nitrous oxide emissions are anthropogenic and are primarily due to agriculture. {2.3, 7.4}  The understanding of anthropogenic warming and cooling influences on climate has improved since the TAR, leading to very high confidence7 that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming, with a radiative forcing of +1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W m-2 (see Figure SPM.2). {2.3., 6.5, 2.9}  - The combined radiative forcing due to increases in carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide is +2.30 [+2.07 to +2.53] W m-2, and its rate of increase during the industrial era is very likely to have been unprecedented in more than 10,000 years (see Figures  Figure SPM.1. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide over the last 10,000 years (large panels) and since 1750 (inset panels). Measurements are shown from ice cores (symbols with different colours for different studies) and atmospheric samples (red lines). The corresponding radiative forcings are shown on the right hand axes of the large panels. {Figure 6.4} - Anthropogenic contributions to aerosols (primarily sulphate, organic carbon, black carbon, nitrate and dust) together produce a cooling effect, with a total direct radiative forcing of -0.5 [-0.9 to -0.1] W m-2 and an indirect cloud albedo forcing of -0.7 [-1.8 to -0.3] W m-2. These forcings are now better understood than at the time of the TAR due to improved in situ, satellite and ground-based measurements and more  comprehensive modelling, but remain the dominant uncertainty in radiative forcing. Aerosols also influence cloud lifetime and precipitation. {2.4, 2.9, 7.5} - Significant anthropogenic contributions to radiative forcing come from several other sources. Tropospheric ozone changes due to emissions of ozone-forming chemicals (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons) contribute +0.35 [+0.25 to +0.65] W m-2. The direct radiative forcing due to changes in halocarbons8 is +0.34 [+0.31 to +0.37] W m-2. Changes in surface albedo, due to land cover changes and deposition of black carbon aerosols on snow, exert respective forcings of -0.2 [-0.4 to 0.0] and +0.1 [0.0 to +0.2] W m-2. Additional terms smaller than -0.1 W m-2 are shown in Figure SPM.2. {2.3, 2.5, 7.2} - Changes in solar irradiance since 1750 are estimated to cause a radiative forcing of +0.12 [+0.06 to +0.30] W m-2, which is less than half the estimate given in the TAR. {2.7} Direct Observations of Recent Climate Change Since the TAR, progress in understanding how climate is changing in space and in time has been gained through improvements and extensions of numerous datasets and data analyses, broader geographical coverage, better understanding of uncertainties, and a wider variety of measurements. Increasingly comprehensive observations are available for glaciers and snow cover since the 1960s, and for sea level and ice sheets since about the past decade. However, data coverage remains limited in some regions. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level (see Figure SPM.3). {3.2, 4.2, 5.5} - Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature9 (since 1850). The updated 100-year linear trend (1906 to 2005) of 0.74-C [0.56-C to 0.92-C] is therefore larger than the corresponding trend for 1901 to 2000 given in the TAR of 0.6-C [0.4-C to 0.8-C]. The linear warming trend over the last 50 years (0.13-C [0.10-C to 0.16-C] per decade) is nearly twice that for the last 100 years. The total temperature increase from 1850-1899 to 2001-2005 is 0.76-C [0.57-C to 0.95-C]. Urban heat island effects are real but local, and have a negligible influence (less than 0.006-C per decade over land and zero over the oceans) on these values. {3.2}  - New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record and are consistent within their respective uncertainties, largely reconciling a discrepancy noted in the TAR. {3.2, 3.4} - The average atmospheric water vapour content has increased since at least the 1980s over land and ocean as well as in the upper troposphere. The increase is broadly consistent with the extra water vapour that warmer air can hold. {3.4} - Observations since 1961 show that the average temperature of the global ocean has increased to depths of at least 3000 m and that the ocean has been absorbing more than 80% of the heat added to the climate system. Such warming causes seawater to expand, contributing to sea level rise (see Table SPM.1). {5.2, 5.5} - Mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined on average in both hemispheres. Widespread decreases in glaciers and ice caps have contributed to sea level rise (ice caps do not include contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets). (See Table SPM.1.) {4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.5} - New data since the TAR now show that losses from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003 (see Table SPM.1). Flow speed has increased for some Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers, which drain ice from the interior of the ice sheets. The corresponding increased ice sheet mass loss has often followed thinning, reduction or loss of ice shelves or loss of floating glacier tongues. Such dynamical ice loss is sufficient to explain most of the Antarctic net mass loss and approximately half of the Greenland net mass loss. The remainder of the ice loss from Greenland has occurred because losses due to melting have exceeded accumulation due to snowfall. {4.6, 4.8, 5.5} - Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm per year over 1961 to 2003. The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003: about 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variability or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. There is high confidence that the rate of observed sea level rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century. The total 20th-century rise is estimated to be 0.17 [0.12 to 0.22] m. {5.5} - For 1993 to 2003, the sum of the climate contributions is consistent within uncertainties with the total sea level rise that is directly observed (see Table SPM.1). These estimates are based on improved satellite and in situ data now available. For the period 1961 to 2003, the sum of climate contributions is estimated to be smaller than the observed sea level rise. The TAR reported a similar discrepancy for 1910 to 1990. {5.5} At continental, regional and ocean basin scales, numerous long-term changes in climate have been observed. These include changes in arctic temperatures and ice, widespread changes in precipitation amounts, ocean salinity, wind patterns and aspects of extreme weather including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones.10 {3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 5.2} - Average arctic temperatures increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years. Arctic temperatures have high decadal variability, and a warm period was also observed from 1925 to 1945. {3.2}  - Satellite data since 1978 show that annual average arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7 [2.1 to 3.3]% per decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]% per decade. These values are consistent with those reported in the TAR. {4.4} - Temperatures at the top of the permafrost layer have generally increased since the 1980s in the Arctic (by up to 3-C). The maximum area covered by seasonally frozen ground has decreased by about 7% in the Northern Hemisphere since 1900, with a decrease in spring of up to 15%. {4.7} - Long-term trends from 1900 to 2005 have been observed in precipitation amount over many large regions.11 Significantly increased precipitation has been observed in eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe and northern and central Asia. Drying has been observed in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia. Precipitation is highly variable spatially and temporally, and data are limited in some regions. Long-term trends have not been observed for the other large regions assessed.11 {3.3, 3.9} - Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by freshening of mid- and high-latitude waters together with increased salinity in low-latitude waters. {5.2}  - Mid-latitude westerly winds have strengthened in both hemispheres since the 1960s. {3.5} - More intense and longer droughts have been observed over wider areas since the 1970s, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. Increased drying linked with higher temperatures and decreased precipitation has contributed to changes in drought. Changes in sea surface temperatures, wind patterns and decreased snowpack and snow cover have also been linked to droughts. {3.3}  - The frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over most land areas, consistent with warming and observed increases of atmospheric water vapour. {3.8, 3.9} - Widespread changes in extreme temperatures have been observed over the last 50 years. Cold days, cold nights and frost have become less frequent, while hot days, hot nights and heat waves have become more frequent (see Table SPM.2). {3.8}   Table notes: a See Table 3.7 for further details regarding definitions. b See Table TS.4, Box TS.5 and Table 9.4. c Decreased frequency of cold days and nights (coldest 10%). d Warming of the most extreme days and nights each year. e Increased frequency of hot days and nights (hottest 10%). f Magnitude of anthropogenic contributions not assessed. Attribution for these phenomena based on expert judgement rather than formal attribution studies. g Extreme high sea level depends on average sea level and on regional weather systems. It is defined here as the highest 1% of hourly values of ob- served sea level at a station for a given reference period. h Changes in observed extreme high sea level closely follow the changes in average sea level. {5.5} It is very likely that anthropogenic activity contributed to a rise in average sea level. {9.5} i In all scenarios, the projected global average sea level at 2100 is higher than in the reference period. {10.6} The effect of changes in regional weather systems on sea level extremes has not been assessed.     - There is observational evidence for an increase in intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, correlated with increases of tropical sea surface temperatures. There are also suggestions of increased intense tropical cyclone activity in some other regions where concerns over data quality are greater. Multi-decadal variability and the quality of the tropical cyclone records prior to routine satellite observations in about 1970 complicate the detection of long-term trends in tropical cyclone activity. There is no clear trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones. {3.8} Some aspects of climate have not been observed to change. {3.2, 3.8, 4.4, 5.3} - A decrease in diurnal temperature range (DTR) was reported in the TAR, but the data available then extended only from 1950 to 1993. Updated observations reveal that DTR has not changed from 1979 to 2004 as both day- and night-time temperature have risen at about the same rate. The trends are highly variable from one region to another. {3.2} - Antarctic sea ice extent continues to show interannual variability and localised changes but no statistically significant average trends, consistent with the lack of warming reflected in atmospheric temperatures averaged across the region. {3.2, 4.4} - There is insufficient evidence to determine whether trends exist in the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the global ocean or in small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes, hail, lightning and dust-storms. {3.8, 5.3}  A Palaeoclimatic Perspective Palaeoclimatic studies use changes in climatically sensitive indicators to infer past changes in global climate on time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. Such proxy data (e.g., tree ring width) may be influenced by both local temperature and other factors such as precipitation, and are often representative of particular seasons rather than full years. Studies since the TAR draw increased confidence from additional data showing coherent behaviour across multiple indicators in different parts of the world. However, uncertainties generally increase with time into the past due to increasingly limited spatial coverage. Palaeoclimatic information supports the interpretation that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 1,300 years. The last time the polar regions were significantly warmer than present for an extended period (about 125,000 years ago), reductions in polar ice volume led to 4 to 6 m of sea level rise. {6.4, 6.6} - Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years. Some recent studies indicate greater variability in Northern Hemisphere temperatures than suggested in the TAR, particularly finding that cooler periods existed in the 12th to 14th, 17th and 19th centuries. Warmer periods prior to the 20th century are within the uncertainty range given in the TAR. {6.6} - Global average sea level in the last interglacial period (about 125,000 years ago) was likely 4 to 6 m higher than during the 20th century, mainly due to the retreat of polar ice. Ice core data indicate that average polar temperatures at that time were 3-C to 5-C higher than present, because of differences in the Earth's orbit. The Greenland Ice Sheet and other arctic ice fields likely contributed no more than 4 m of the observed sea level rise. There may also have been a contribution from Antarctica. {6.4} Understanding and Attributing Climate Change This assessment considers longer and improved records, an expanded range of observations and improvements in the simulation of many aspects of climate and its variability based on studies since the TAR. It also considers the results of new attribution studies that have evaluated whether observed changes are quantitatively consistent with the expected response to external forcings and inconsistent with alternative physically plausible explanations. Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.12 This is an advance since the TAR's conclusion that ""most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations"". Discernible human influences now extend to other aspects of climate, including ocean warming, continental-average temperatures, temperature extremes and wind patterns (see Figure SPM.4 and Table SPM.2). {9.4, 9.5} - It is likely that increases in greenhouse gas concentrations alone would have caused more warming than observed because volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols have offset some warming that would otherwise have taken place. {2.9, 7.5, 9.4} - The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone. {4.8, 5.2, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7}  - Warming of the climate system has been detected in changes of surface and atmospheric temperatures in the upper several hundred metres of the ocean, and in contributions to sea level rise. Attribution studies have established anthropogenic contributions to all of these changes. The observed pattern of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling is very likely due to the combined influences of greenhouse gas increases and stratospheric ozone depletion. {3.2, 3.4, 9.4, 9.5} - It is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent except Antarctica (see Figure SPM.4). The observed patterns of warming, including greater warming over land than over the ocean, and their changes over time, are only simulated by models that include anthropogenic forcing. The ability of coupled climate models to simulate the observed temperature evolution on each of six continents provides stronger evidence of human influence on climate than was available in the TAR. {3.2, 9.4} - Difficulties remain in reliably simulating and attributing observed temperature changes at smaller scales. On these scales, natural climate variability is relatively larger, making it harder to distinguish changes expected due to external forcings. Uncertainties in local forcings and feedbacks also make it difficult to estimate the contribution of greenhouse gas increases to observed small-scale temperature changes. {8.3, 9.4} - Anthropogenic forcing is likely to have contributed to changes in wind patterns,13 affecting extratropical storm tracks and temperature patterns in both hemispheres. However, the observed changes in the Northern Hemisphere circulation are larger than simulated in response to 20th-century forcing change. {3.5, 3.6, 9.5, 10.3} - Temperatures of the most extreme hot nights, cold nights and cold days are likely to have increased due to anthropogenic forcing. It is more likely than not that anthropogenic forcing has increased the risk of heat waves (see Table SPM.2). {9.4}  GLOBAL AND CONTINENTAL TEMPERATURE CHANGE   Figure SPM.4. Comparison of observed continental- and global-scale changes in surface temperature with results simulated by climate models using natural and anthropogenic forcings. Decadal averages of observations are shown for the period 1906 to 2005 (black line) plotted against the centre of the decade and relative to the corresponding average for 1901-1950. Lines are dashed where spatial coverage is less than 50%. Blue shaded bands show the 5-95% range for 19 simulations from five climate models using only the natural forcings due to solar activity and volcanoes. Red shaded bands show the 5-95% range for 58 simulations from 14 climate models using both natural and anthropogenic forcings. {FAQ 9.2, Figure 1}    Analysis of climate models together with constraints from observations enables an assessed likely range to be given for climate sensitivity for the first time and provides increased confidence in the understanding of the climate system response to radiative forcing. {6.6, 8.6, 9.6, Box 10.2} - The equilibrium climate sensitivity is a measure of the climate system response to sustained radiative forcing. It is not a projection but is defined as the global average surface warming following a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations. It is likely to be in the range 2-C to 4.5-C with a best estimate of about 3-C, and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5-C. Values substantially higher than 4.5-C cannot be excluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as good for those values. Water vapour changes represent the largest feedback affecting climate sensitivity and are now better understood than in the TAR. Cloud feedbacks remain the largest source of uncertainty. {8.6, 9.6, Box 10.2} - It is very unlikely that climate changes of at least the seven centuries prior to 1950 were due to variability generated within the climate system alone. A significant fraction of the reconstructed Northern Hemisphere inter-decadal temperature variability over those centuries is very likely attributable to volcanic eruptions and changes in solar irradiance, and it is likely that anthropogenic forcing contributed to the early 20th century warming evident in these records. {2.7, 2.8, 6.6, 9.3}  Projections of Future Changes in Climate A major advance of this assessment of climate change projections compared with the TAR is the large number of simulations available from a broader range of models. Taken together with additional information from observations, these provide a quantitative basis for estimating likelihoods for many aspects of future climate change. Model simulations cover a range of possible futures including idealised emission or concentration assumptions. These include SRES14 illustrative marker scenarios for the 2000 to 2100 period and model experiments with greenhouse gases and aerosol concentrations held constant after year 2000 or 2100. For the next two decades, a warming of about 0.2-C per decade is projected for a range of SRES emission scenarios. Even if the concentrations of all greenhouse gases and aerosols had been kept constant at year 2000 levels, a further warming of about 0.1-C per decade would be expected. {10.3, 10.7} - Since IPCC's first report in 1990, assessed projections have suggested global average temperature increases between about 0.15-C and 0.3-C per decade for 1990 to 2005. This can now be compared with observed values of about 0.2-C per decade, strengthening confidence in near-term projections. {1.2, 3.2}  - Model experiments show that even if all radiative forcing agents were held constant at year 2000 levels, a further warming trend would occur in the next two decades at a rate of about 0.1-C per decade, due mainly to the slow response of the oceans. About twice as much warming (0.2-C per decade) would be expected if emissions are within the range of the SRES scenarios. Best-estimate projections from models indicate that decadal average warming over each inhabited continent by 2030 is insensitive to the choice among SRES scenarios and is very likely to be at least twice as large as the corresponding model-estimated natural variability during the 20th century. {9.4, 10.3, 10.5, 11.2-11.7, Figure TS-29}   Continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century. {10.3} - Advances in climate change modelling now enable best estimates and likely assessed uncertainty ranges to be given for projected warming for different emission scenarios. Results for different emission scenarios are provided explicitly in this report to avoid loss of this policy-relevant information. Projected global average surface warmings for the end of the 21st century (2090-2099) relative to 1980-1999 are shown in Table SPM.3. These illustrate the differences between lower and higher SRES emission scenarios, and the projected warming uncertainty associated with these scenarios. {10.5} - Best estimates and likely ranges for global average surface air warming for six SRES emissions marker scenarios are given in this assessment and are shown in Table SPM.3. For example, the best estimate for the low scenario (B1) is 1.8-C (likely range is 1.1-C to 2.9-C), and the best estimate for the high scenario  (A1FI) is 4.0-C (likely range is 2.4-C to 6.4-C). Although these projections are broadly consistent with the span quoted in the TAR (1.4-C to 5.8-C), they are not directly comparable (see Figure SPM.5). The Fourth Assessment Report is more advanced as it provides best estimates and an assessed likelihood range for each of the marker scenarios. The new assessment of the likely ranges now relies on a larger number of climate models of increasing complexity and realism, as well as new information regarding the nature of feedbacks from the carbon cycle and constraints on climate response from observations. {10.5} - Warming tends to reduce land and ocean uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing the fraction of anthropogenic emissions that remains in the atmosphere. For the A2 scenario, for example, the climate-carbon cycle feedback increases the corresponding global average warming at 2100 by more than 1-C. Assessed upper ranges for temperature projections are larger than in the TAR (see Table SPM.3) mainly because the broader range of models now available suggests stronger climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. {7.3, 10.5} - Model-based projections of global average sea level rise at the end of the 21st century (2090-2099) are shown in Table SPM.3. For each scenario, the midpoint of the range in Table SPM.3 is within 10% of the   TAR model average for 2090-2099. The ranges are narrower than in the TAR mainly because of improved information about some uncertainties in the projected contributions.15 {10.6} - Models used to date do not include uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feedback nor do they include the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow, because a basis in published literature is lacking. The projections include a contribution due to increased ice flow from Greenland and Antarctica at the rates observed for 1993 to 2003, but these flow rates could increase or decrease in the future. For example, if this contribution were to grow linearly with global average temperature change,  the upper ranges of sea level rise for SRES scenarios shown in Table SPM.3 would increase by 0.1 to 0.2 m. Larger values cannot be excluded, but understanding of these effects is too limited to assess their likelihood or provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level rise. {10.6} - Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations lead to increasing acidification of the ocean. Projections based on SRES scenarios give reductions in average global surface ocean pH16 of between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st century, adding to the present decrease of 0.1 units since pre-industrial times. {5.4, Box 7.3, 10.4}  There is now higher confidence in projected patterns of warming and other regional-scale features, including changes in wind patterns, precipitation and some aspects of extremes and of ice. {8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 9.4, 9.5, 10.3, 11.1} - Projected warming in the 21st century shows scenario-independent geographical patterns similar to those observed over the past several decades. Warming is expected to be greatest over land and at most high northern latitudes, and least over the Southern Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean (see Figure SPM.6). {10.3} - Snow cover is projected to contract. Widespread increases in thaw depth are projected over most permafrost regions. {10.3, 10.6}  - Sea ice is projected to shrink in both the Arctic and Antarctic under all SRES scenarios. In some projections, arctic late-summer sea ice disappears almost entirely by the latter part of the 21st century. {10.3} - It is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves and heavy precipitation events will continue to become more frequent. {10.3} - Based on a range of models, it is likely that future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more intense, with larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation associated with ongoing increases of tropical sea surface temperatures. There is less confidence in projections of a global decrease in numbers of tropical cyclones. The apparent increase in the proportion of very intense storms since 1970 in some regions is much larger than simulated by current models for that period. {9.5, 10.3, 3.8}  - Extratropical storm tracks are projected to move poleward, with consequent changes in wind, precipitation and temperature patterns, continuing the broad pattern of observed trends over the last half century. {3.6, 10.3} - Since the TAR, there is an improving understanding of projected patterns of precipitation. Increases in the amount of precipitation are very likely in high latitudes, while decreases are likely in most subtropical land regions (by as much as about 20% in the A1B scenario in 2100, see Figure SPM.7), continuing observed patterns in recent trends. {3.3, 8.3, 9.5, 10.3, 11.2 to 11.9} - Based on current model simulations, it is very likely that the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the Atlantic Ocean will slow down during the 21st century. The multi-model average reduction by 2100 is 25% (range from zero to about 50%) for SRES emission scenario A1B. Temperatures in the Atlantic region are projected to increase despite such changes due to the much larger warming associated with projected increases in greenhouse gases. It is very unlikely that the MOC will undergo a large abrupt transition during the 21st century. Longer-term changes in the MOC cannot be assessed with confidence. {10.3, 10.7}  Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries due to the time scales associated with climate processes and feedbacks, even if greenhouse gas concentrations were to be stabilised. {10.4, 10.5, 10.7} - Climate-carbon cycle coupling is expected to add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere as the climate system warms, but the magnitude of this feedback is uncertain. This increases the uncertainty in the trajectory of carbon dioxide emissions required to achieve a particular stabilisation level of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Based on current understanding of climate-carbon cycle feedback, model studies suggest that to stabilise at 450 ppm carbon dioxide could require that cumulative emissions over the 21st century be reduced from an average of approximately 670 [630 to 710] GtC (2460 [2310 to 2600] GtCO2) to approximately 490 [375 to 600] GtC (1800 [1370 to 2200] GtCO2). Similarly, to stabilise at 1000 ppm, this feedback could require that cumulative emissions be reduced from a model average of approximately 1415 [1340 to 1490] GtC (5190 [4910 to 5460] GtCO2) to approximately 1100 [980 to 1250] GtC (4030 [3590 to 4580] GtCO2). {7.3, 10.4} - If radiative forcing were to be stabilised in 2100 at B1 or A1B levels14 a further increase in global average temperature of about 0.5-C would still be expected, mostly by 2200. {10.7} - If radiative forcing were to be stabilised in 2100 at A1B levels14, thermal expansion alone would lead to 0.3 to 0.8 m of sea level rise by 2300 (relative to 1980-1999). Thermal expansion would continue for many centuries, due to the time required to transport heat into the deep ocean. {10.7} - Contraction of the Greenland Ice Sheet is projected to continue to contribute to sea level rise after 2100. Current models suggest that ice mass losses increase with temperature more rapidly than gains due to precipitation and that the surface mass balance becomes negative at a global average warming (relative to pre-industrial values) in excess of 1.9-C to 4.6-C. If a negative surface mass balance were sustained for millennia, that would lead to virtually complete elimination of the Greenland Ice Sheet and a resulting contribution to sea level rise of about 7 m. The corresponding future temperatures in Greenland  are comparable to those inferred for the last interglacial period 125,000 years ago, when palaeoclimatic information suggests reductions of polar land ice extent and 4 to 6 m of sea level rise. {6.4, 10.7} - Dynamical processes related to ice flow not included in current models but suggested by recent observations could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to warming, increasing future sea level rise. Understanding of these processes is limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude. {4.6, 10.7} - Current global model studies project that the Antarctic Ice Sheet will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and is expected to gain in mass due to increased snowfall. However, net loss of ice mass could occur if dynamical ice discharge dominates the ice sheet mass balance. {10.7} - Both past and future anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions will continue to contribute to warming and sea level rise for more than a millennium, due to the time scales required for removal of this gas from the atmosphere. {7.3, 10.3}   THE EMISSION SCENARIOS OF THE IPCC SPECIAL REPORT ON EMISSION SCENARIOS (SRES)17 A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil-intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy sources (A1T) or a balance across all sources (A1B) (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply to all energy supply and end use technologies). A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously increasing population. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological change more fragmented and slower than other storylines. B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same global population, that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives. B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population, at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented towards environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels. An illustrative scenario was chosen for each of the six scenario groups A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1 and B2. All should be considered equally sound. The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol.

IPCC-2007-2.txt,"Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers Introduction This Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It provides an integrated view of climate change as the final part of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). A complete elaboration of the Topics covered in this summary can be found in this Synthesis Report and in the underlying reports of the three Working Groups. 1. Observed changes in climate and their effects Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level (Figure SPM.1). {1.1} Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature (since 1850). The 100-year linear trend (1906-2005) of 0.74 [0.56 to 0.92]�C1 is larger than the corresponding trend of 0.6 [0.4 to 0.8]�C (1901-2000) given in the Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Figure SPM.1). The temperature increase is widespread over the globe and is greater at higher northern latitudes. Land regions have warmed faster than the oceans (Figures SPM.2, SPM.4). {1.1, 1.2} Rising sea level is consistent with warming (Figure SPM.1). Global average sea level has risen since 1961 at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm/yr and since 1993 at 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm/yr, with contributions from thermal expansion, melting glaciers and ice caps, and the polar ice sheets. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variation or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. {1.1} Observed decreases in snow and ice extent are also consistent with warming (Figure SPM.1). Satellite data since 1978 show that annual average Arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7 [2.1 to 3.3]% per decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]% per decade. Mountain glaciers and snow cover on average have declined in both hemispheres. {1.1} From 1900 to 2005, precipitation increased significantly in eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe and northern and central Asia but declined in the Sahel, the  Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia. Globally, the area affected by drought has likely2 increased since the 1970s. {1.1} It is very likely that over the past 50 years: cold days, cold nights and frosts have become less frequent over most land areas, and hot days and hot nights have become more frequent. It is likely that: heat waves have become more frequent over most land areas, the frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over most areas, and since 1975 the incidence of extreme high sea level3 has increased worldwide. {1.1} There is observational evidence of an increase in intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, with limited evidence of increases elsewhere. There is no clear trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones. It is difficult to ascertain longer-term trends in cyclone activity, particularly prior to 1970. {1.1} Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1300 years. {1.1} Observational evidence4 from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases. {1.2} Changes in snow, ice and frozen ground have with high confidence increased the number and size of glacial lakes, increased ground instability in mountain and other permafrost regions and led to changes in some Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems. {1.2} There is high confidence that some hydrological systems have also been affected through increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier- and snow-fed rivers and through effects on thermal structure and water quality of warming rivers and lakes. {1.2} In terrestrial ecosystems, earlier timing of spring events and poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges are with very high confidence linked to recent warming. In some marine and freshwater systems, shifts in ranges and changes in algal, plankton and fish abundance are with high confidence associated with rising water temperatures, as well as related changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels and circulation. {1.2} Of the more than 29,000 observational data series, from 75 studies, that show significant change in many physical and biological systems, more than 89% are consistent with the direction of change expected as a response to warming (Figure SPM.2). However, there is a notable lack of geographic balance in data and literature on observed changes, with marked scarcity in developing countries. {1.2, 1.3} There is medium confidence that other effects of regional climate change on natural and human environments are emerging, although many are difficult to discern due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers. {1.2} They include effects of temperature increases on: {1.2} agricultural and forestry management at Northern Hemisphere higher latitudes, such as earlier spring planting of  crops, and alterations in disturbance regimes of forests due to fires and pests some aspects of human health, such as heat-related mortality in Europe, changes in infectious disease vectors in some areas, and allergenic pollen in Northern Hemisphere high and mid-latitudes some human activities in the Arctic (e.g. hunting and travel over snow and ice) and in lower-elevation alpine areas (such as mountain sports).  Figure SPM.2. Locations of significant changes in data series of physical systems (snow, ice and frozen ground; hydrology; and coastal processes) and biological systems (terrestrial, marine and freshwater biological systems), are shown together with surface air temperature changes over the period 1970-2004. A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies. These met the following criteria: (1) ending in 1990 or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction, as assessed in individual studies. These data series are from about 75 studies (of which about 70 are new since the TAR) and contain about 29,000 data series, of which about 28,000 are from European studies. White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to estimate a temperature trend. The 2 � 2 boxes show the total number of data series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM), Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) global-scale: Terrestrial (TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and Global (GLO). The numbers of studies from the seven regional boxes (NAM, EUR, AFR, AS, ANZ, PR) do not add up to the global (GLO) totals because numbers from regions except Polar do not include the numbers related to Marine and Freshwater (MFW) systems. Locations of large-area marine changes are not shown on the map. {Figure 1.2}  2. Causes of change  Changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system. {2.2}  Global GHG emissions due to human activities have grown since pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70% between 1970 and 2004 (Figure SPM.3).5 {2.1} Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important anthropogenic GHG. Its annual emissions grew by about 80% between 1970 and 2004. The long-term trend of declining CO emissions per unit of energy supplied reversed after 2000. {2.1}  Global atmospheric concentrations of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have increased markedly as a result of human activities since 1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values determined from ice cores spanning many thousands of years. {2.2}  Atmospheric concentrations of CO (379ppm) and CH  (1774ppb) in 2005 exceed by far the natural range over the  last 650,000 years. Global increases in CO2 concentrations  are due primarily to fossil fuel use, with land-use change providing another significant but smaller contribution. It is very likely that the observed increase in CH4 concentration is predominantly due to agriculture and fossil fuel use. CH4 growth rates have declined since the early 1990s, consistent with total emissions (sum of anthropogenic and natural sources) being nearly constant during this period. The increase in N2O concentration is primarily due to agriculture. {2.2} There is very high confidence that the net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming.6 {2.2} Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations.7 It is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent (except Antarctica) (Figure SPM.4). {2.4} During the past 50 years, the sum of solar and volcanic forcings would likely have produced cooling. Observed patterns of warming and their changes are simulated only by models that include anthropogenic forcings. Difficulties remain in simulating and attributing observed temperature changes at smaller than continental scales. {2.4}  Figure SPM.3. (a) Global annual emissions of anthropogenic GHGs from 1970 to 2004.5 (b) Share of different anthropogenic GHGs in total emissions in 2004 in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq). (c) Share of different sectors in total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2004 in terms of CO2-eq. (Forestry includes deforestation.) {Figure 2.1}  Figure SPM.4. Comparison of observed continental- and global-scale changes in surface temperature with results simulated by climate models using either natural or both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Decadal averages of observations are shown for the period 1906-2005 (black line) plotted against the centre of the decade and relative to the corresponding average for the period 1901-1950. Lines are dashed where spatial coverage is less than 50%. Blue shaded bands show the 5 to 95% range for 19 simulations from five climate models using only the natural forcings due to solar activity and volcanoes. Red shaded bands show the 5 to 95% range for 58 simulations from 14 climate models using both natural and anthropogenic forcings. {Figure 2.5}  Advances since the TAR show that discernible human influences extend beyond average temperature to other aspects of climate. {2.4} Human influences have: {2.4} very likely contributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century likely contributed to changes in wind patterns, affecting extra-tropical storm tracks and temperature patterns likely increased temperatures of extreme hot nights, cold nights and cold days more likely than not increased risk of heat waves, area affected by drought since the 1970s and frequency of heavy precipitation events.  Anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has likely had a discernible influence at the global scale on observed changes in many physical and biological systems. {2.4} Spatial agreement between regions of significant warming across the globe and locations of significant observed changes in many systems consistent with warming is very unlikely to be due solely to natural variability. Several modelling studies have linked some specific responses in physical and biological systems to anthropogenic warming. {2.4} More complete attribution of observed natural system responses to anthropogenic warming is currently prevented by the short time scales of many impact studies, greater natural climate variability at regional scales, contributions of nonclimate factors and limited spatial coverage of studies. {2.4}  3. Projected climate change and its impacts There is high agreement and much evidence that with current climate change mitigation policies and related sustainable development practices, global GHG emissions will continue to grow over the next few decades. {3.1} The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, 2000) projects an increase of global GHG emissions by 25 to 90% (CO2-eq) between 2000 and 2030 (Figure SPM.5), with fossil fuels maintaining their dominant position in the global energy mix to 2030 and beyond. More recent scenarios without additional emissions mitigation are comparable in range.8,9 {3.1} Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.5). {3.2.1}  For the next two decades a warming of about 0.2�C per decade is projected for a range of SRES emissions scenarios. Even if the concentrations of all GHGs and aerosols had been kept constant at year 2000 levels, a further warming of about 0.1�C per decade would be expected. Afterwards, temperature projections increasingly depend on specific emissions scenarios. {3.2} The range of projections (Table SPM.1) is broadly consistent with the TAR, but uncertainties and upper ranges for temperature are larger mainly because the broader range of available models suggests stronger climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. Warming reduces terrestrial and ocean uptake of atmospheric CO2, increasing the fraction of anthropogenic emissions remaining in the atmosphere. The strength of this feedback effect varies markedly among models. {2.3, 3.2.1} Because understanding of some important effects driving sea level rise is too limited, this report does not assess the likelihood, nor provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level rise. Table SPM.1 shows model-based projections   of global average sea level rise for 2090-2099.10 The projections do not include uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feedbacks nor the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow, therefore the upper values of the ranges are not to be considered upper bounds for sea level rise. They include a contribution from increased Greenland and Antarctic ice flow at the rates observed for 1993-2003, but this could increase or decrease in the future.11 {3.2.1} There is now higher confidence than in the TAR in projected patterns of warming and other regional-scale features, including changes in wind patterns, precipitation and some aspects of extremes and sea ice. {3.2.2} Regional-scale changes include: {3.2.2} warming greatest over land and at most high northern latitudes and least over Southern Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean, continuing recent observed trends (Figure SPM.6) contraction of snow cover area, increases in thaw depth over most permafrost regions and decrease in sea ice extent; in some projections using SRES scenarios, Arctic late-summer sea ice disappears almost entirely by the latter part of the 21st century very likely increase in frequency of hot extremes, heat waves and heavy precipitation likely increase in tropical cyclone intensity; less confidence in global decrease of tropical cyclone numbers  poleward shift of extra-tropical storm tracks with consequent changes in wind, precipitation and temperature patterns very likely precipitation increases in high latitudes and likely decreases in most subtropical land regions, continuing observed recent trends. There is high confidence that by mid-century, annual river runoff and water availability are projected to increase at high latitudes (and in some tropical wet areas) and decrease in some dry regions in the mid-latitudes and tropics. There is also high confidence that many semi-arid areas (e.g. Mediterranean Basin, western United States, southern Africa and north-eastern Brazil) will suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change. {3.3.1, Figure 3.5} Studies since the TAR have enabled more systematic understanding of the timing and magnitude of impacts related to differing amounts and rates of climate change. {3.3.1, 3.3.2} Figure SPM.7 presents examples of this new information for systems and sectors. The top panel shows impacts increasing with increasing temperature change. Their estimated magnitude and timing is also affected by development pathway (lower panel). {3.3.1} Examples of some projected impacts for different regions are given in Table SPM.2.  Figure SPM.6. Projected surface temperature changes for the late 21st century (2090-2099). The map shows the multi-AOGCM average projection for the A1B SRES scenario. Temperatures are relative to the period 1980-1999. {Figure 3.2}  Some systems, sectors and regions are likely to be especially affected by climate change.12 {3.3.3} Systems and sectors: {3.3.3} particular ecosystems: - terrestrial: tundra, boreal forest and mountain regions because of sensitivity to warming; mediterranean-type ecosystems because of reduction in rainfall; and tropical rainforests where precipitation declines - coastal: mangroves and salt marshes, due to multiple stresses - marine: coral reefs due to multiple stresses; the sea ice biome because of sensitivity to warming water resources in some dry regions at mid-latitudes13 and in the dry tropics, due to changes in rainfall and evapotranspiration, and in areas dependent on snow and ice melt agriculture in low latitudes, due to reduced water availability low-lying coastal systems, due to threat of sea level rise and increased risk from extreme weather events human health in populations with low adaptive capacity. Regions: {3.3.3} the Arctic, because of the impacts of high rates of projected warming on natural systems and human communities  Africa, because of low adaptive capacity and projected climate change impacts small islands, where there is high exposure of population and infrastructure to projected climate change impacts Asian and African megadeltas, due to large populations and high exposure to sea level rise, storm surges and river flooding. Within other areas, even those with high incomes, some people (such as the poor, young children and the elderly) can be particularly at risk, and also some areas and some activities. {3.3.3} Ocean acidification The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in pH of 0.1 units. Increasing atmospheric CO concentrations lead to further acidification. Projections based on SRES scenarios give a reduction in average global surface ocean pH of between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st century. While the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented, the progressive acidification of oceans is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming organisms (e.g. corals) and their dependent species. {3.3.4} Figure SPM.7. Examples of impacts associated with projected global average surface warming. Upper panel: Illustrative examples of global impacts projected for climate changes (and sea level and atmospheric CO2 where relevant) associated with different amounts of increase in global average surface temperature in the 21st century. The black lines link impacts; broken-line arrows indicate impacts continuing with increasing temperature. Entries are placed so that the left-hand side of text indicates the approximate level of warming that is associated with the onset of a given impact. Quantitative entries for water scarcity and flooding represent the additional impacts of climate change relative to the conditions projected across the range of SRES scenarios A1FI, A2, B1 and B2. Adaptation to climate change is not included in these estimations. Confidence levels for all statements are high. Lower panel: Dots and bars indicate the best estimate and likely ranges of warming assessed for the six Table SPM.2. Examples of some projected regional impacts. {3.3.2}  Africa  By 2020, between 75 and 250 million of people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change. By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%. Agricultural production, including access to food, in many African countries is projected to be severely compromised. This would further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition. Towards the end of the 21st century, projected sea level rise will affect low-lying coastal areas with large populations. The cost of adaptation could amount to at least 5 to 10% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By 2080, an increase of 5 to 8% of arid and semi-arid land in Africa is projected under a range of climate scenarios (TS).  Asia  By the 2050s, freshwater availability in Central, South, East and South-East Asia, particularly in large river basins, is projected to decrease. Coastal areas, especially heavily populated megadelta regions in South, East and South-East Asia, will be at greatest risk due to increased flooding from the sea and, in some megadeltas, flooding from the rivers. Climate change is projected to compound the pressures on natural resources and the environment associated with rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and economic development. Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease primarily associated with floods and droughts are expected to rise in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in the hydrological cycle.  Australia and New Zealand  By 2020, significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur in some ecologically rich sites, including the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland Wet Tropics. By 2030, water security problems are projected to intensify in southern and eastern Australia and, in New Zealand, in Northland and some eastern regions. By 2030, production from agriculture and forestry is projected to decline over much of southern and eastern Australia, and over parts of eastern New Zealand, due to increased drought and fire. However, in New Zealand, initial benefits are projected in some other regions. By 2050, ongoing coastal development and population growth in some areas of Australia and New Zealand are projected to exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding.  Europe  Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in Europe's natural resources and assets. Negative impacts will include increased risk of inland flash floods and more frequent coastal flooding and increased erosion (due to storminess and sea level rise). Mountainous areas will face glacier retreat, reduced snow cover and winter tourism, and extensive species losses (in some areas up to 60% under high emissions scenarios by 2080). In southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen conditions (high temperatures and drought) in a region already vulnerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability, hydropower potential, summer tourism and, in general, crop productivity. Climate change is also projected to increase the health risks due to heat waves and the frequency of wildfires.  Latin America  By mid-century, increases in temperature and associated decreases in soil water are projected to lead to gradual replacement of tropical forest by savanna in eastern Amazonia. Semi-arid vegetation will tend to be replaced by arid-land vegetation. There is a risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many areas of tropical Latin America. Productivity of some important crops is projected to decrease and livestock productivity to decline, with adverse consequences for food security. In temperate zones, soybean yields are projected to increase. Overall, the number of people at risk of hunger is projected to increase (TS; medium confidence). Changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of glaciers are projected to significantly affect water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation.  North America  Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources. In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilised water resources. Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse health impacts. Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution.  Polar Regions  The main projected biophysical effects are reductions in thickness and extent of glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice, and changes in natural ecosystems with detrimental effects on many organisms including migratory birds, mammals and higher predators. For human communities in the Arctic, impacts, particularly those resulting from changing snow and ice conditions, are projected to be mixed. Detrimental impacts would include those on infrastructure and traditional indigenous ways of life. In both polar regions, specific ecosystems and habitats are projected to be vulnerable, as climatic barriers to species invasions are lowered.  Small Islands  Sea level rise is expected to exacerbate inundation, storm surge, erosion and other coastal hazards, thus threatening vital infrastructure, settlements and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities. Deterioration in coastal conditions, for example through erosion of beaches and coral bleaching, is expected to affect local resources. By mid-century, climate change is expected to reduce water resources in many small islands, e.g. in the Caribbean and Pacific, to the point where they become insufficient to meet demand during low-rainfall periods. With higher temperatures, increased invasion by non-native species is expected to occur, particularly on mid- and high-latitude islands.  Note: Unless stated explicitly, all entries are from Working Group II SPM text, and are either very high confidence or high confidence statements, reflecting different sectors (agriculture, ecosystems, water, coasts, health, industry and settlements). The Working Group II SPM refers to the source of the statements, timelines and temperatures. The magnitude and timing of impacts that will ultimately be realised will vary with the amount and rate of climate change, emissions scenarios, development pathways and adaptation.  Altered frequencies and intensities of extreme weather, together with sea level rise, are expected to have mostly adverse effects on natural and human systems. {3.3.5} Examples for selected extremes and sectors are shown in Table SPM.3. Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries due to the time scales associated with climate processes and feedbacks, even if GHG concentrations were to be stabilised. {3.2.3} Estimated long-term (multi-century) warming corresponding to the six AR4 Working Group III stabilisation categories is shown in Figure SPM.8.  Contraction of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to continue to contribute to sea level rise after 2100. Current models suggest virtually complete elimination of the Greenland ice sheet and a resulting contribution to sea level rise of about 7m if global average warming were sustained for millennia in excess of 1.9 to 4.6�C relative to pre-industrial values. The corresponding future temperatures in Greenland are comparable to those inferred for the last interglacial period 125,000 years ago, when palaeoclimatic information suggests reductions of polar land ice extent and 4 to 6m of sea level rise. {3.2.3} Current global model studies project that the Antarctic ice sheet will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and gain mass due to increased snowfall. However, net loss of ice mass could occur if dynamical ice discharge dominates the ice sheet mass balance. {3.2.3}   Figure SPM.8. Estimated long-term (multi-century) warming corresponding to the six AR4 Working Group III stabilisation categories (Table SPM.6). The temperature scale has been shifted by -0.5�C compared to Table SPM.6 to account approximately for the warming between preindustrial and 1980-1999. For most stabilisation levels global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level over a few centuries. For GHG emissions scenarios that lead to stabilisation at levels comparable to SRES B1 and A1B by 2100 (600 and 850ppm CO2-eq; category IV and V), assessed models project that about 65 to 70% of the estimated global equilibrium temperature increase, assuming a climate sensitivity of 3�C, would be realised at the time of stabilisation. For the much lower stabilisation scenarios (category I and II, Figure SPM.11), the equilibrium temperature may be reached earlier. {Figure 3.4}    Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change. {3.4} Partial loss of ice sheets on polar land could imply metres of sea level rise, major changes in coastlines and inundation of low-lying areas, with greatest effects in river deltas and low-lying islands. Such changes are projected to occur over  millennial time scales, but more rapid sea level rise on century time scales cannot be excluded. {3.4} Climate change is likely to lead to some irreversible impacts. There is medium confidence that approximately 20 to 30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5 to 2.5�C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average  temperature increase exceeds about 3.5�C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40 to 70% of species assessed) around the globe. {3.4} Based on current model simulations, the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the Atlantic Ocean will very likely slow down during the 21st century; nevertheless temperatures over the Atlantic and Europe are projected to increase. The MOC is very unlikely to undergo a large abrupt transition during the 21st century. Longer-term MOC changes cannot be assessed with confidence. Impacts of large-scale and persistent changes in the MOC are likely to include changes in marine ecosystem productivity, fisheries, ocean CO2 uptake, oceanic oxygen concentrations and terrestrial vegetation. Changes in terrestrial and ocean CO2 uptake may feed back on the climate system. {3.4} 4. Adaptation and mitigation optionsA wide array of adaptation options is available, but more extensive adaptation than is currently occurring is required to reduce vulnerability to climate change. There are barriers, limits and costs, which are not fully understood. {4.2} Societies have a long record of managing the impacts of weather- and climate-related events. Nevertheless, additional adaptation measures will be required to reduce the adverse impacts of projected climate change and variability, regardless of the scale of mitigation undertaken over the next two to three decades. Moreover, vulnerability to climate change can be exacerbated by other stresses. These arise from, for example, current climate hazards, poverty and unequal access to resources, food insecurity, trends in economic globalisation, conflict and incidence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. {4.2} Some planned adaptation to climate change is already occurring on a limited basis. Adaptation can reduce vulner-  ability, especially when it is embedded within broader sectoral initiatives (Table SPM.4). There is high confidence that there are viable adaptation options that can be implemented in some sectors at low cost, and/or with high benefit-cost ratios. However, comprehensive estimates of global costs and benefits of adaptation are limited. {4.2, Table 4.1} Adaptive capacity is intimately connected to social and economic development but is unevenly distributed across and within societies. {4.2} A range of barriers limits both the implementation and effectiveness of adaptation measures. The capacity to adapt is dynamic and is influenced by a society's productive base, including natural and man-made capital assets, social networks and entitlements, human capital and institutions, governance, national income, health and technology. Even societies with high adaptive capacity remain vulnerable to climate change, variability and extremes. {4.2} Both bottom-up and top-down studies indicate that there is high agreement and much evidence of substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global GHG emissions over the coming decades that could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below current levels (Figures SPM.9, SPM.10).15 While top-down and bottom-up studies are in line at the global level (Figure SPM.9) there are considerable differences at the sectoral level. {4.3} No single technology can provide all of the mitigation potential in any sector. The economic mitigation potential, which is generally greater than the market mitigation potential, can only be achieved when adequate policies are in place and barriers removed (Table SPM.5). {4.3} Bottom-up studies suggest that mitigation opportunities with net negative costs have the potential to reduce emissions by around 6 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2030, realising which requires dealing with implementation barriers. {4.3}  14 While this Section deals with adaptation and mitigation separately, these responses can be complementary. This theme is discussed in Section 5. 15 The concept of `mitigation potential' has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission baselines, for a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigation potential is further differentiated in terms of `market mitigation potential' and `economic mitigation potential'. Market mitigation potential is the mitigation potential based on private costs and private discount rates (reflecting the perspective of private consumers and companies), which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in place, noting that barriers limit actual uptake. Economic mitigation potential is the mitigation potential that takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates (reflecting the perspective of society; social discount rates are lower than those used by private investors), assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and measures and barriers are removed. Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options, emphasising specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Top-down studies assess the economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about mitigation options and capture macro-economic and market feedbacks.  Table SPM.4.

Note: GHG emissions in 2000 are exclusive of emissions of decay of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation and from peat fires and drained peat soils, to ensure consistency with the SRES emission results. {Figure 4.1}   Figure SPM.10. Estimated economic mitigation potential by sector in 2030 from bottom-up studies, compared to the respective baselines assumed in the sector assessments. The potentials do not include non-technical options such as lifestyle changes. {Figure 4.2} Notes: a) The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector. b) The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels. c) Sectors used different baselines. For industry, the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport, the World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2004 baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces were used to construct a waste-specific baseline; agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces. d) Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included. e) Categories excluded are: non-CO2 emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and co-generation in energy supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewater treatment, emission reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, and fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underestimation of the total economic potential from these emissions is of the order of 10 to 15%.

Stability of national policy important in view of international competitiveness Predictable allocation mechanisms and stable price signals important for investments Success factors include: clear targets, a baseline scenario, third-party involvement in design and review and formal provisions of monitoring, close cooperation between government and industry  Financial incentives and regulations for improved land management; maintaining soil carbon content; efficient use of fertilisers and irrigation  May encourage synergy with sustainable development and with reducing vulnerability to climate change, thereby overcoming barriers to implementation  Financial incentives (national and international) to increase forest area, to reduce deforestation and to maintain and manage forests; land-use regulation and enforcement Financial incentives for improved waste and wastewater management Renewable energy incentives or obligations Waste management regulations  Constraints include lack of investment capital and land tenure issues. Can help poverty alleviation May stimulate technology diffusion Local availability of low-cost fuel Most effectively applied at national level with enforcement strategies  A wide variety of policies and instruments are available to governments to create the incentives for mitigation action. Their applicability depends on national circumstances and sectoral context (Table SPM.5). {4.3} They include integrating climate policies in wider development policies, regulations and standards, taxes and charges, tradable permits, financial incentives, voluntary agreements, information instruments, and research, development and demonstration (RD&D). {4.3} An effective carbon-price signal could realise significant mitigation potential in all sectors. Modelling studies show that global carbon prices rising to US$20-80/tCO2-eq by 2030 are consistent with stabilisation at around 550ppm CO2-eq by 2100. For the same stabilisation level, induced technological change may lower these price ranges to US$5-65/tCO2-eq in 2030.17 {4.3} There is high agreement and much evidence that mitigation actions can result in near-term co-benefits (e.g. improved health due to reduced air pollution) that may offset a substantial fraction of mitigation costs. {4.3} There is high agreement and medium evidence that Annex I countries' actions may affect the global economy and global emissions, although the scale of carbon leakage remains uncertain.18 {4.3} Fossil fuel exporting nations (in both Annex I and non-Annex I countries) may expect, as indicated in the TAR, lower demand and prices and lower GDP growth due to mitigation policies. The extent of this spillover depends strongly on assumptions related to policy decisions and oil market conditions. {4.3} There is also high agreement and medium evidence that changes in lifestyle, behaviour patterns and management practices can contribute to climate change mitigation across all sectors. {4.3} Many options for reducing global GHG emissions through international cooperation exist. There is high agreement and much evidence that notable achievements of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol are the establishment of a global response to climate change, stimulation of an array of national policies, and the creation of an international carbon market and new institutional mechanisms that may provide the foundation  for future mitigation efforts. Progress has also been made in addressing adaptation within the UNFCCC and additional international initiatives have been suggested. {4.5} Greater cooperative efforts and expansion of market mechanisms will help to reduce global costs for achieving a given level of mitigation, or will improve environmental effectiveness. Efforts can include diverse elements such as emissions targets; sectoral, local, sub-national and regional actions; RD&D programmes; adopting common policies; implementing development-oriented actions; or expanding financing instruments. {4.5} In several sectors, climate response options can be implemented to realise synergies and avoid conflicts with other dimensions of sustainable development. Decisions about macroeconomic and other non-climate policies can significantly affect emissions, adaptive capacity and vulnerability. {4.4, 5.8} Making development more sustainable can enhance mitigative and adaptive capacities, reduce emissions and reduce vulnerability, but there may be barriers to implementation. On the other hand, it is very likely that climate change can slow the pace of progress towards sustainable development. Over the next half-century, climate change could impede achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. {5.8} 5. The long-term perspective Determining what constitutes ""dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"" in relation to Article 2 of the UNFCCC involves value judgements. Science can support informed decisions on this issue, including by providing criteria for judging which vulnerabilities might be labelled `key'. {Box `Key Vulnerabilities and Article 2 of the UNFCCC', Topic 5} Key vulnerabilities19 may be associated with many climate-sensitive systems, including food supply, infrastructure, health, water resources, coastal systems, ecosystems, global biogeochemical cycles, ice sheets and modes of oceanic and atmospheric circulation. {Box `Key Vulnerabilities and Article 2 of the UNFCCC', Topic 5}   The five `reasons for concern' identified in the TAR remain a viable framework to consider key vulnerabilities. These `reasons' are assessed here to be stronger than in the TAR. Many risks are identified with higher confidence. Some risks are projected to be larger or to occur at lower increases in temperature. Understanding about the relationship between impacts (the basis for `reasons for concern' in the TAR) and vulnerability (that includes the ability to adapt to impacts) has improved. {5.2} This is due to more precise identification of the circumstances that make systems, sectors and regions especially vulnerable and growing evidence of the risks of very large impacts on multiple-century time scales. {5.2} Risks to unique and threatened systems. There is new and stronger evidence of observed impacts of climate change on unique and vulnerable systems (such as polar and high mountain communities and ecosystems), with increasing levels of adverse impacts as temperatures increase further. An increasing risk of species extinction and coral reef damage is projected with higher confidence than in the TAR as warming proceeds. There is medium confidence that approximately 20 to 30% of plant and animal species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed 1.5 to 2.5�C over 1980-1999 levels. Confidence has increased that a 1 to 2�C increase in global mean temperature above 1990 levels (about 1.5 to 2.5�C above preindustrial) poses significant risks to many unique and threatened systems including many biodiversity hotspots. Corals are vulnerable to thermal stress and have low adaptive capacity. Increases in sea surface temperature of about 1 to 3�C are projected to result in more frequent coral bleaching events and widespread mortality, unless there is thermal adaptation or acclimatisation by corals. Increasing vulnerability of indigenous communities in the Arctic and small island communities to warming is projected. {5.2} Risks of extreme weather events. Responses to some recent extreme events reveal higher levels of vulnerability than the TAR. There is now higher confidence in the projected increases in droughts, heat waves and floods, as well as their adverse impacts. {5.2} Distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities. There are sharp differences across regions and those in the weakest economic position are often the most vulnerable to climate change. There is increasing evidence of greater vulnerability of specific groups such as the poor and elderly not only in developing but also in developed countries. Moreover, there is increased evidence that low-latitude and less developed areas generally face greater risk, for example in dry areas and megadeltas. {5.2}  Aggregate impacts. Compared to the TAR, initial net market-based benefits from climate change are projected to peak at a lower magnitude of warming, while damages would be higher for larger magnitudes of warming. The net costs of impacts of increased warming are projected to increase over time. {5.2} Risks of large-scale singularities. There is high confidence that global warming over many centuries would lead to a sea level rise contribution from thermal expansion alone that is projected to be much larger than observed over the 20th century, with loss of coastal area and associated impacts. There is better understanding than in the TAR that the risk of additional contributions to sea level rise from both the Greenland and possibly Antarctic ice sheets may be larger than projected by ice sheet models and could occur on century time scales. This is because ice dynamical processes seen in recent observations but not fully included in ice sheet models assessed in the AR4 could increase the rate of ice loss. {5.2} There is high confidence that neither adaptation nor mitigation alone can avoid all climate change impacts; however, they can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change. {5.3} Adaptation is necessary in the short and longer term to address impacts resulting from the warming that would occur even for the lowest stabilisation scenarios assessed. There are barriers, limits and costs, but these are not fully understood. Unmitigated climate change would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt. The time at which such limits could be reached will vary between sectors and regions. Early mitigation actions would avoid further locking in carbon intensive infrastructure and reduce climate change and associated adaptation needs. {5.2, 5.3} Many impacts can be reduced, delayed or avoided by mitigation. Mitigation efforts and investments over the next two to three decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels. Delayed emission reductions significantly constrain the opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and increase the risk of more severe climate change impacts. {5.3, 5.4, 5.7} In order to stabilise the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, emissions would need to peak and decline thereafter. The lower the stabilisation level, the more quickly this peak and decline would need to occur.20 {5.4} Table SPM.6 and Figure SPM.11 summarise the required emission levels for different groups of stabilisation concentrations and the resulting equilibrium global warming and long-  term sea level rise due to thermal expansion only.21 The timing and level of mitigation to reach a given temperature stabilisation level is earlier and more stringent if climate sensitivity is high than if it is low. {5.4, 5.7} Sea level rise under warming is inevitable. Thermal expansion would continue for many centuries after GHG concentrations have stabilised, for any of the stabilisation levels assessed, causing an eventual sea level rise much larger than projected for the 21st century. The eventual contributions from Greenland ice sheet loss could be several metres, and larger than from thermal expansion, should warming in excess of 1.9 to 4.6�C above pre-industrial be sustained over many centuries. The long time scales of thermal expansion and ice sheet response to warming imply that stabilisation of GHG concentrations at or above present levels would not stabilise sea level for many centuries. {5.3, 5.4} There is high agreement and much evidence that all stabilisation levels assessed can be achieved by  deployment of a portfolio of technologies that are either currently available or expected to be commercialised in coming decades, assuming appropriate and effective incentives are in place for their development, acquisition, deployment and diffusion and addressing related barriers. {5.5} All assessed stabilisation scenarios indicate that 60 to 80% of the reductions would come from energy supply and use and industrial processes, with energy efficiency playing a key role in many scenarios. Including non-CO2 and CO2 land-use and forestry mitigation options provides greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Low stabilisation levels require early investments and substantially more rapid diffusion and commercialisation of advanced low-emissions technologies. {5.5} Without substantial investment flows and effective technology transfer, it may be difficult to achieve emission reduction at a significant scale. Mobilising financing of incremental costs of low-carbon technologies is important. {5.5}  Table SPM.6. Characteristics of post-TAR stabilisation scenarios and resulting long-term equilibrium global average temperature and the sea level rise component from thermal expansion only.a {Table 5.1}  Notes: a) The emission reductions to meet a particular stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underestimated due to missing carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Topic 2.3). b) Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 379ppm in 2005. The best estimate of total CO2-eq concentration in 2005 for all long-lived GHGs is about 455ppm, while the corresponding value including the net effect of all anthropogenic forcing agents is 375ppm CO2-eq. c) Ranges correspond to the 15th to 85th percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO2 emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios can be compared with CO2-only scenarios (see Figure SPM.3). d) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3�C. e) Note that global average temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global average temperature at the time of stabilisation of GHG concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentrations occurs between 2100 and 2150 (see also Footnote 21). f) Equilibrium sea level rise is for the contribution from ocean thermal expansion only and does not reach equilibrium for at least many centuries. These values have been estimated using relatively simple climate models (one low-resolution AOGCM and several EMICs based on the best estimate of 3�C climate sensitivity) and do not include contributions from melting ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps. Long-term thermal expansion is projected to result in 0.2 to 0.6m per degree Celsius of global average warming above pre-industrial. (AOGCM refers to Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model and EMICs to Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.)   Figure SPM.11.

Approaching equilibrium can take several centuries, especially for scenarios with higher levels of stabilisation. Coloured shadings show stabilisation scenarios grouped according to different targets (stabilisation category I to VI). The right-hand panel shows ranges of global average temperature change above pre-industrial, using (i) `best estimate' climate sensitivity of 3�C (black line in middle of shaded area), (ii) upper bound of likely range of climate sensitivity of 4.5�C (red line at top of shaded area) (iii) lower bound of likely range of climate sensitivity of 2�C (blue line at bottom of shaded area). Black dashed lines in the left panel give the emissions range of recent baseline scenarios published since the SRES (2000). Emissions ranges of the stabilisation scenarios comprise CO2-only and multi-gas scenarios and correspond to the 10th to 90th percentile of the full scenario distribution. Note: CO2 emissions in most models do not include emissions from decay of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation, and from peat fires and drained peat soils. {Figure 5.1}  Notes: Values given in this table correspond to the full literature across all baselines and mitigation scenarios that provide GDP numbers. a) Global GDP based on market exchange rates. b) The 10th and 90th percentile range of the analysed data are given where applicable.

High emissions baselines generally lead to higher costs. e) The values correspond to the highest estimate for GDP reduction shown in column three.  Responding to climate change involves an iterative risk management process that includes both adaptation and mitigation and takes into account climate change damages, co-benefits, sustainability, equity and attitudes to risk. {5.1} Impacts of climate change are very likely to impose net annual costs, which will increase over time as global temperatures increase. Peer-reviewed estimates of the social cost of carbon23 in 2005 average US$12 per tonne of CO2, but the range from 100 estimates is large (-$3 to $95/tCO2). This is due in large part to differences in assumptions regarding climate sensitivity, response lags, the treatment of risk and equity, economic and non-economic impacts, the inclusion of potentially catastrophic losses and discount rates. Aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts  across sectors, regions and populations and very likely underestimate damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifiable impacts. {5.7} Limited and early analytical results from integrated analyses of the costs and benefits of mitigation indicate that they are broadly comparable in magnitude, but do not as yet permit an unambiguous determination of an emissions pathway or stabilisation level where benefits exceed costs. {5.7} Climate sensitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation scenarios for specific temperature levels. {5.4} Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation involve balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission reductions now against the corresponding medium-term and long-term climate risks of delay. {5.7}    "
IPCC-2007-3.txt,"Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Summary for Policymakers A. Introduction This Summary sets out the key policy-relevant findings of the Fourth Assessment of Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Assessment is of current scientific understanding of the impacts of climate change on natural, managed and human systems, the capacity of these systems to adapt and their vulnerability.1 It builds upon past IPCC assessments and incorporates new knowledge gained since the Third Assessment. Statements in this Summary are based on chapters in the Assessment and principal sources are given at the end of each paragraph.B. Current knowledge about observed impacts of climate change on the natural and human environment  Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases. With regard to changes in snow, ice and frozen ground (including permafrost),4 there is high confidence that natural systems are affected. Examples are: � enlargement and increased numbers of glacial lakes [1.3]; � increasing ground instability in permafrost regions, and rock avalanches in mountain regions [1.3]; � changes in some Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems, including those in sea-ice biomes, and also predators high in the food chain [1.3, 4.4, 15.4]. Based on growing evidence, there is high confidence that the following effects on hydrological systems are occurring: � increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier- and snow-fed rivers [1.3]; � warming of lakes and rivers in many regions, with effects on thermal structure and water quality [1.3].  A full consideration of observed climate change is provided in the Working Group I Fourth Assessment. This part of the Working Group II Summary concerns the relationship between observed climate change and recent observed changes in the natural and human environment. The statements presented here are based largely on data sets that cover the period since 1970. The number of studies of observed trends in the physical and biological environment and their relationship to regional climate changes has increased greatly since the Third Assessment in 2001. The quality of the data sets has also improved. There is, however, a notable lack of geographical balance in the data and literature on observed changes, with marked scarcity in developing countries. Recent studies have allowed a broader and more confident assessment of the relationship between observed warming and impacts than was made in the Third Assessment. That Assessment concluded that ""there is high confidence3 that recent regional changes in temperature have had discernible impacts on many physical and biological systems"". From the current Assessment we conclude the following.  There is very high confidence, based on more evidence from a wider range of species, that recent warming is strongly affecting terrestrial biological systems, including such changes as: � earlier timing of spring events, such as leaf-unfolding, bird migration and egg-laying [1.3]; � poleward and upward shifts in ranges in plant and animal species [1.3, 8.2, 14.2]. Based on satellite observations since the early 1980s, there is high confidence that there has been a trend in many regions towards earlier `greening'5 of vegetation in the spring linked to longer thermal growing seasons due to recent warming [1.3, 14.2]. There is high confidence, based on substantial new evidence, that observed changes in marine and freshwater biological systems are associated with rising water temperatures, as well as related changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels and circulation [1.3]. These include: � shifts in ranges and changes in algal, plankton and fish abundance in high-latitude oceans [1.3]; � increases in algal and zooplankton abundance in high-latitude and high-altitude lakes [1.3]; � range changes and earlier migrations of fish in rivers [1.3].   The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic, with an average decrease in pH of 0.1 units [IPCC Working Group I Fourth Assessment]. However, the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented [1.3]. A global assessment of data since 1970 has shown it is likely6 that anthropogenic warming has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems.   Much more evidence has accumulated over the past five years to indicate that changes in many physical and biological systems are linked to anthropogenic warming. There are four sets of evidence which, taken together, support this conclusion:  Other effects of regional climate changes on natural and human environments are emerging, although many are difficult to discern due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers.  1. The Working Group I Fourth Assessment concluded that most of the observed increase in the globally averaged temperature since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. 2. Of the more than 29,000 observational data series,7 from 75 studies, that show significant change in many physical and biological systems, more than 89% are consistent with the direction of change expected as a response to warming (Figure SPM.1) [1.4]. 3. A global synthesis of studies in this Assessment strongly demonstrates that the spatial agreement between regions of significant warming across the globe and the locations of significant observed changes in many systems consistent with warming is very unlikely to be due solely to natural variability of temperatures or natural variability of the systems (Figure SPM.1) [1.4]. 4. Finally, there have been several modelling studies that have linked responses in some physical and biological systems to anthropogenic warming by comparing observed responses in these systems with modelled responses in which the natural forcings (solar activity and volcanoes) and anthropogenic forcings (greenhouse gases and aerosols) are explicitly separated. Models with combined natural and anthropogenic forcings simulate observed responses significantly better than models with natural forcing only [1.4]. Limitations and gaps prevent more complete attribution of the causes of observed system responses to anthropogenic warming. First, the available analyses are limited in the number of systems and locations considered. Second, natural temperature variability is larger at the regional than at the global scale, thus affecting identification of changes due to external forcing. Finally, at the regional scale other factors (such as land-use change, pollution, and invasive species) are influential [1.4]. Nevertheless, the consistency between observed and modelled changes in several studies and the spatial agreement between significant regional warming and consistent impacts at the global scale is sufficient to conclude with high confidence that anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems [1.4].   Figure SPM.1. Locations of significant changes in data series of physical systems (snow, ice and frozen ground; hydrology; and coastal processes) and biological systems (terrestrial, marine, and freshwater biological systems), are shown together with surface air temperature changes over the period 1970-2004. A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies. These met the following criteria: (1) ending in 1990 or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction, as assessed in individual studies. These data series are from about 75 studies (of which about 70 are new since the Third Assessment) and contain about 29,000 data series, of which about 28,000 are from European studies. White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to estimate a temperature trend. The 2 x 2 boxes show the total number of data series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM), Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) global-scale: Terrestrial (TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and Global (GLO). The numbers of studies from the seven regional boxes (NAM, ..., PR) do not add up to the global (GLO) totals because numbers from regions except Polar do not include the numbers related to Marine and Freshwater (MFW) systems. Locations of large-area marine changes are not shown on the map. [Working Group II Fourth Assessment F1.8, F1.9; Working Group I Fourth Assessment F3.9b].    C. Current knowledge about future impacts The following is a selection of the key findings regarding projected impacts, as well as some findings on vulnerability and adaptation, in each system, sector and region for the range of (unmitigated) climate changes projected by the IPCC over this century8 judged to be relevant for people and the environment.9 The impacts frequently reflect projected changes in precipitation and other climate variables in addition to temperature, sea level and concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The magnitude and timing of impacts will vary with the amount and timing of climate change and, in some cases, the capacity to adapt. These issues are discussed further in later sections of the Summary. More specific information is now available across a wide range of systems and sectors concerning the nature of future impacts, including for some fields not covered in previous assessments. Freshwater resources and their management By mid-century, annual average river runoff and water availability are projected to increase by 10-40% at high latitudes and in some wet tropical areas, and decrease by 10-30% over some dry regions at mid-latitudes and in the dry tropics, some of which are presently water-stressed areas. In some places and in particular seasons, changes differ from these annual figures. ** D10 [3.4] Drought-affected areas will likely increase in extent. Heavy precipitation events, which are very likely to increase in frequency, will augment flood risk. ** N [Working Group I Fourth Assessment Table SPM-2, Working Group II Fourth Assessment 3.4] In the course of the century, water supplies stored in glaciers and snow cover are projected to decline, reducing water availability in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges, where more than one-sixth of the world population currently lives. ** N [3.4] Adaptation procedures and risk management practices for the water sector are being developed in some countries and regions that have recognised projected hydrological changes with related uncertainties. *** N [3.6]  Ecosystems The resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded this century by an unprecedented combination of climate change, associated disturbances (e.g., flooding, drought, wildfire, insects, ocean acidification), and other global change drivers (e.g., landuse change, pollution, over-exploitation of resources). ** N [4.1 to 4.6] Over the course of this century, net carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems is likely to peak before mid-century and then weaken or even reverse,11 thus amplifying climate change. ** N [4.ES, F4.2] Approximately 20-30% of plant and animal species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed 1.5-2.5�C. * N [4.4, T4.1] For increases in global average temperature exceeding 1.5-2.5�C and in concomitant atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, there are projected to be major changes in ecosystem structure and function, species' ecological interactions, and species' geographical ranges, with predominantly negative consequences for biodiversity, and ecosystem goods and services e.g., water and food supply. ** N [4.4] The progressive acidification of oceans due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming organisms (e.g., corals) and their dependent species. * N [B4.4, 6.4] Food, fibre and forest products Crop productivity is projected to increase slightly at mid- to high latitudes for local mean temperature increases of up to 1-3�C depending on the crop, and then decrease beyond that in some regions. * D [5.4] At lower latitudes, especially seasonally dry and tropical regions, crop productivity is projected to decrease for even small local temperature increases (1-2�C), which would increase the risk of hunger. * D [5.4] Globally, the potential for food production is projected to increase with increases in local average temperature over a range of 1-3�C, but above this it is projected to decrease. * D [5.4, 5.6]   Increases in the frequency of droughts and floods are projected to affect local crop production negatively, especially in subsistence sectors at low latitudes. ** D [5.4, 5.ES] Adaptations such as altered cultivars and planting times allow low- and mid- to high-latitude cereal yields to be maintained at or above baseline yields for modest warming. * N [5.5] Globally, commercial timber productivity rises modestly with climate change in the short- to medium-term, with large regional variability around the global trend. * D [5.4]  The most vulnerable industries, settlements and societies are generally those in coastal and river flood plains, those whose economies are closely linked with climate-sensitive resources, and those in areas prone to extreme weather events, especially where rapid urbanisation is occurring. ** D [7.1, 7.3 to 7.5] Poor communities can be especially vulnerable, in particular those concentrated in high-risk areas. They tend to have more limited adaptive capacities, and are more dependent on climate-sensitive resources such as local water and food supplies. ** N [7.2, 7.4, 5.4]  Regional changes in the distribution and production of particular fish species are expected due to continued warming, with adverse effects projected for aquaculture and fisheries. ** D [5.4] Coastal systems and low-lying areas Coasts are projected to be exposed to increasing risks, including coastal erosion, due to climate change and sea-level rise. The effect will be exacerbated by increasing human-induced pressures on coastal areas. *** D [6.3, 6.4] Corals are vulnerable to thermal stress and have low adaptive capacity. Increases in sea surface temperature of about 1-3�C are projected to result in more frequent coral bleaching events and widespread mortality, unless there is thermal adaptation or acclimatisation by corals. *** D [B6.1, 6.4] Coastal wetlands including salt marshes and mangroves are projected to be negatively affected by sea-level rise especially where they are constrained on their landward side, or starved of sediment. *** D [6.4] Many millions more people are projected to be flooded every year due to sea-level rise by the 2080s. Those densely-populated and low-lying areas where adaptive capacity is relatively low, and which already face other challenges such as tropical storms or local coastal subsidence, are especially at risk. The numbers affected will be largest in the mega-deltas of Asia and Africa while small islands are especially vulnerable. *** D [6.4] Adaptation for coasts will be more challenging in developing countries than in developed countries, due to constraints on adaptive capacity. ** D [6.4, 6.5, T6.11]  Where extreme weather events become more intense and/or more frequent, the economic and social costs of those events will increase, and these increases will be substantial in the areas most directly affected. Climate change impacts spread from directly impacted areas and sectors to other areas and sectors through extensive and complex linkages. ** N [7.4, 7.5] Health Projected climate change-related exposures are likely to affect the health status of millions of people, particularly those with low adaptive capacity, through: � increases in malnutrition and consequent disorders, with implications for child growth and development; � increased deaths, disease and injury due to heatwaves, floods, storms, fires and droughts; � the increased burden of diarrhoeal disease; � the increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases due to higher concentrations of ground-level ozone related to climate change; and, � the altered spatial distribution of some infectious disease vectors. ** D [8.4, 8.ES, 8.2] Climate change is expected to have some mixed effects, such as a decrease or increase in the range and transmission potential of malaria in Africa. ** D [8.4] Studies in temperate areas12 have shown that climate change is projected to bring some benefits, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure. Overall it is expected that these benefits will be outweighed by the negative health effects of rising temperatures worldwide, especially in developing countries. ** D [8.4]  Industry, settlement and society Costs and benefits of climate change for industry, settlement and society will vary widely by location and scale. In the aggregate, however, net effects will tend to be more negative the larger the change in climate. ** N [7.4, 7.6]  The balance of positive and negative health impacts will vary from one location to another, and will alter over time as temperatures continue to rise. Critically important will be factors that directly shape the health of populations such as education, health care, public health initiatives and infrastructure and economic development. *** N [8.3]  More specific information is now available across the regions of the world concerning the nature of future impacts, including for some places not covered in previous assessments.  Freshwater availability in Central, South, East and South-East Asia, particularly in large river basins, is projected to decrease due to climate change which, along with population growth and increasing demand arising from higher standards of living, could adversely affect more than a billion people by the 2050s. ** N [10.4]  Africa By 2020, between 75 million and 250 million people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change. If coupled with increased demand, this will adversely affect livelihoods and exacerbate water-related problems. ** D [9.4, 3.4, 8.2, 8.4] Agricultural production, including access to food, in many African countries and regions is projected to be severely compromised by climate variability and change. The area suitable for agriculture, the length of growing seasons and yield potential, particularly along the margins of semi-arid and arid areas, are expected to decrease. This would further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition in the continent. In some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50% by 2020. ** N [9.2, 9.4, 9.6] Local food supplies are projected to be negatively affected by decreasing fisheries resources in large lakes due to rising water temperatures, which may be exacerbated by continued overfishing. ** N [9.4, 5.4, 8.4] Towards the end of the 21st century, projected sea-level rise will affect low-lying coastal areas with large populations. The cost of adaptation could amount to at least 5-10% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Mangroves and coral reefs are projected to be further degraded, with additional consequences for fisheries and tourism. ** D [9.4] New studies confirm that Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change because of multiple stresses and low adaptive capacity. Some adaptation to current climate variability is taking place; however, this may be insufficient for future changes in climate. ** N [9.5] Asia Glacier melt in the Himalayas is projected to increase flooding, and rock avalanches from destabilised slopes, and to affect water resources within the next two to three decades. This will be followed by decreased river flows as the glaciers recede. * N [10.2, 10.4]  Coastal areas, especially heavily-populated megadelta regions in South, East and South-East Asia, will be at greatest risk due to increased flooding from the sea and, in some megadeltas, flooding from the rivers. ** D [10.4] Climate change is projected to impinge on the sustainable development of most developing countries of Asia, as it compounds the pressures on natural resources and the environment associated with rapid urbanisation, industrialisation, and economic development. ** D [10.5] It is projected that crop yields could increase up to 20% in East and South-East Asia while they could decrease up to 30% in Central and South Asia by the mid-21st century. Taken together, and considering the influence of rapid population growth and urbanisation, the risk of hunger is projected to remain very high in several developing countries. * N [10.4] Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease primarily associated with floods and droughts are expected to rise in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in the hydrological cycle associated with global warming. Increases in coastal water temperature would exacerbate the abundance and/or toxicity of cholera in South Asia. **N [10.4] Australia and New Zealand As a result of reduced precipitation and increased evaporation, water security problems are projected to intensify by 2030 in southern and eastern Australia and, in New Zealand, in Northland and some eastern regions. ** D [11.4] Significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur by 2020 in some ecologically rich sites including the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland Wet Tropics. Other sites at risk include Kakadu wetlands, south-west Australia, sub-Antarctic islands and the alpine areas of both countries. *** D [11.4] Ongoing coastal development and population growth in areas such as Cairns and South-east Queensland (Australia) and Northland to Bay of Plenty (New Zealand), are projected to exacerbate risks from sea-level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding by 2050. *** D [11.4, 11.6]  Production from agriculture and forestry by 2030 is projected to decline over much of southern and eastern Australia, and over parts of eastern New Zealand, due to increased drought and fire. However, in New Zealand, initial benefits are projected in western and southern areas and close to major rivers due to a longer growing season, less frost and increased rainfall. ** N [11.4]  Adaptation to climate change is likely to benefit from experience gained in reaction to extreme climate events, specifically by implementing proactive climate change risk management adaptation plans. *** N [12.5] Latin America  The region has substantial adaptive capacity due to well-developed economies and scientific and technical capabilities, but there are considerable constraints to implementation and major challenges from changes in extreme events. Natural systems have limited adaptive capacity. ** N [11.2, 11.5] Europe For the first time, wide-ranging impacts of changes in current climate have been documented: retreating glaciers, longer growing seasons, shift of species ranges, and health impacts due to a heatwave of unprecedented magnitude. The observed changes described above are consistent with those projected for future climate change. *** N [12.2, 12.4, 12.6] Nearly all European regions are anticipated to be negatively affected by some future impacts of climate change, and these will pose challenges to many economic sectors. Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in Europe's natural resources and assets. Negative impacts will include increased risk of inland flash floods, and more frequent coastal flooding and increased erosion (due to storminess and sea-level rise). The great majority of organisms and ecosystems will have difficulty adapting to climate change. Mountainous areas will face glacier retreat, reduced snow cover and winter tourism, and extensive species losses (in some areas up to 60% under high emission scenarios by 2080). *** D [12.4] In Southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen conditions (high temperatures and drought) in a region already vulnerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability, hydropower potential, summer tourism and, in general, crop productivity. It is also projected to increase health risks due to heatwaves, and the frequency of wildfires. ** D [12.2, 12.4, 12.7] In Central and Eastern Europe, summer precipitation is projected to decrease, causing higher water stress. Health risks due to heatwaves are projected to increase. Forest productivity is expected to decline and the frequency of peatland fires to increase. ** D [12.4] In Northern Europe, climate change is initially projected to bring mixed effects, including some benefits such as reduced demand for heating, increased crop yields and increased forest growth. However, as climate change continues, its negative impacts (including more frequent winter floods, endangered ecosystems and increasing ground instability) are likely to outweigh its benefits. ** D [12.4]  By mid-century, increases in temperature and associated decreases in soil water are projected to lead to gradual replacement of tropical forest by savanna in eastern Amazonia. Semi-arid vegetation will tend to be replaced by arid-land vegetation. There is a risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many areas of tropical Latin America. ** D [13.4] In drier areas, climate change is expected to lead to salinisation and desertification of agricultural land. Productivity of some important crops is projected to decrease and livestock productivity to decline, with adverse consequences for food security. In temperate zones soybean yields are projected to increase. ** N [13.4, 13.7] Sea-level rise is projected to cause increased risk of flooding in low-lying areas. Increases in sea surface temperature due to climate change are projected to have adverse effects on Mesoamerican coral reefs, and cause shifts in the location of south-east Pacific fish stocks. ** N [13.4, 13.7] Changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of glaciers are projected to significantly affect water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation. ** D [13.4] Some countries have made efforts to adapt, particularly through conservation of key ecosystems, early warning systems, risk management in agriculture, strategies for flood drought and coastal management, and disease surveillance systems. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is outweighed by: lack of basic information, observation and monitoring systems; lack of capacity building and appropriate political, institutional and technological frameworks; low income; and settlements in vulnerable areas, among others. ** D [13.2] North America Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding, and reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources. *** D [14.4, B14.2] Disturbances from pests, diseases and fire are projected to have increasing impacts on forests, with an extended period of high fire risk and large increases in area burned. *** N [14.4, B14.1] Moderate climate change in the early decades of the century is projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5-20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilised water resources. ** D [14.4] Cities that currently experience heatwaves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number, intensity and duration of heatwaves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse health impacts. Elderly populations are most at risk. *** D [14.4]. Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution. Population growth and the rising value of infrastructure in coastal areas increase vulnerability to climate variability and future climate change, with losses projected to increase if the intensity of tropical storms increases. Current adaptation is uneven and readiness for increased exposure is low. *** N [14.2, 14.4] Polar Regions In the Polar Regions, the main projected biophysical effects are reductions in thickness and extent of glaciers and ice sheets, and changes in natural ecosystems with detrimental effects on many organisms including migratory birds, mammals and higher predators. In the Arctic, additional impacts include reductions in the extent of sea ice and permafrost, increased coastal erosion, and an increase in the depth of permafrost seasonal thawing. ** D [15.3, 15.4, 15.2] For human communities in the Arctic, impacts, particularly those resulting from changing snow and ice conditions, are projected to be mixed. Detrimental impacts would include those on infrastructure and traditional indigenous ways of life. ** D [15.4]  effects of climate change, sea-level rise and extreme events. *** D [16.1, 16.5] Deterioration in coastal conditions, for example through erosion of beaches and coral bleaching, is expected to affect local resources, e.g., fisheries, and reduce the value of these destinations for tourism. ** D [16.4] Sea-level rise is expected to exacerbate inundation, storm surge, erosion and other coastal hazards, thus threatening vital infrastructure, settlements and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities. *** D [16.4] Climate change is projected by mid-century to reduce water resources in many small islands, e.g., in the Caribbean and Pacific, to the point where they become insufficient to meet demand during low-rainfall periods. *** D [16.4] With higher temperatures, increased invasion by non-native species is expected to occur, particularly on mid- and high-latitude islands. ** N [16.4] Magnitudes of impact can now be estimated more systematically for a range of possible increases in global average temperature. Since the IPCC Third Assessment, many additional studies, particularly in regions that previously had been little researched, have enabled a more systematic understanding of how the timing and magnitude of impacts may be affected by changes in climate and sea level associated with differing amounts and rates of change in global average temperature.  Beneficial impacts would include reduced heating costs and more navigable northern sea routes. * D [15.4] In both polar regions, specific ecosystems and habitats are projected to be vulnerable, as climatic barriers to species invasions are lowered. ** D [15.6, 15.4] Arctic human communities are already adapting to climate change, but both external and internal stressors challenge their adaptive capacities. Despite the resilience shown historically by Arctic indigenous communities, some traditional ways of life are being threatened and substantial investments are needed to adapt or re-locate physical structures and communities. ** D [15.ES, 15.4, 15.5, 15.7]  Examples of this new information are presented in Figure SPM.2. Entries have been selected which are judged to be relevant for people and the environment and for which there is high confidence in the assessment. All examples of impact are drawn from chapters of the Assessment, where more detailed information is available. Depending on circumstances, some of these impacts could be associated with `key vulnerabilities', based on a number of criteria in the literature (magnitude, timing, persistence/reversibility, the potential for adaptation, distributional aspects, likelihood and `importance' of the impacts). Assessment of potential key vulnerabilities is intended to provide information on rates and levels of climate change to help decision-makers make appropriate responses to the risks of climate change [19.ES, 19.1].  Small islands Small islands, whether located in the tropics or higher latitudes, have characteristics which make them especially vulnerable to the Figure SPM.2. Illustrative examples of global impacts projected for climate changes (and sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide where relevant) associated with different amounts of increase in global average surface temperature in the 21st century [T20.8]. The black lines link impacts, dotted arrows indicate impacts continuing with increasing temperature. Entries are placed so that the left-hand side of the text indicates the approximate onset of a given impact. Quantitative entries for water stress and flooding represent the additional impacts of climate change relative to the conditions projected across the range of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) scenarios A1FI, A2, B1 and B2 (see Endbox 3). Adaptation to climate change is not included in these estimations. All entries are from published studies recorded in the chapters of the Assessment. Sources are given in the right-hand column of the Table. Confidence levels for all statements are high.   Impacts of climate change will vary regionally but, aggregated and discounted to the present, they are very likely to impose net annual costs which will increase over time as global temperatures increase.  Since the IPCC Third Assessment, confidence has increased that some weather events and extremes will become more frequent, more widespread and/or more intense during the 21st century; and more is known about the potential effects of such changes. A selection of these is presented in Table SPM.1. The direction of trend and likelihood of phenomena are for IPCC SRES projections of climate change. Some large-scale climate events have the potential to cause very large impacts, especially after the 21st century. Very large sea-level rises that would result from widespread deglaciation of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets imply major changes in coastlines and ecosystems, and inundation of low-lying areas, with greatest effects in river deltas. Relocating populations, economic activity, and infrastructure would be costly and challenging. There is medium confidence that at least partial deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet, and possibly the West Antarctic ice sheet, would occur over a period of time ranging from centuries to millennia for a global average temperature increase of 1-4�C (relative to 1990-2000), causing a contribution to sea-level rise of 4-6 m or more. The complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet would lead to a contribution to sea-level rise of up to 7 m and about 5 m, respectively [Working Group I Fourth Assessment 6.4, 10.7; Working Group II Fourth Assessment 19.3]. Based on climate model results, it is very unlikely that the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) in the North Atlantic will undergo a large abrupt transition during the 21st century. Slowing of the MOC during this century is very likely, but temperatures over the Atlantic and Europe are projected to increase nevertheless, due to global warming. Impacts of large-scale and persistent changes in the MOC are likely to include changes to marine ecosystem productivity, fisheries, ocean carbon dioxide uptake, oceanic oxygen concentrations and terrestrial vegetation [Working Group I Fourth Assessment 10.3, 10.7; Working Group II Fourth Assessment 12.6, 19.3].  This Assessment makes it clear that the impacts of future climate change will be mixed across regions. For increases in global mean temperature of less than 1-3�C above 1990 levels, some impacts are projected to produce benefits in some places and some sectors, and produce costs in other places and other sectors. It is, however, projected that some low-latitude and polar regions will experience net costs even for small increases in temperature. It is very likely that all regions will experience either declines in net benefits or increases in net costs for increases in temperature greater than about 2-3�C [9.ES, 9.5, 10.6, T10.9, 15.3, 15.ES]. These observations confirm evidence reported in the Third Assessment that, while developing countries are expected to experience larger percentage losses, global mean losses could be 1-5% GDP for 4�C of warming [F20.3]. Many estimates of aggregate net economic costs of damages from climate change across the globe (i.e., the social cost of carbon (SCC), expressed in terms of future net benefits and costs that are discounted to the present) are now available. Peer-reviewed estimates of the SCC for 2005 have an average value of US$43 per tonne of carbon (i.e., US$12 per tonne of carbon dioxide), but the range around this mean is large. For example, in a survey of 100 estimates, the values ran from US$-10 per tonne of carbon (US$-3 per tonne of carbon dioxide) up to US$350 per tonne of carbon (US$95 per tonne of carbon dioxide) [20.6]. The large ranges of SCC are due in the large part to differences in assumptions regarding climate sensitivity, response lags, the treatment of risk and equity, economic and non-economic impacts, the inclusion of potentially catastrophic losses, and discount rates. It is very likely that globally aggregated figures underestimate the damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifiable impacts. Taken as a whole, the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time [T20.3, 20.6, F20.4]. It is virtually certain that aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions, countries and populations. In some locations and among some groups of people with high exposure, high sensitivity and/or low adaptive capacity, net costs will be significantly larger than the global aggregate [20.6, 20.ES, 7.4].     Table SPM.1. Examples of possible impacts of climate change due to changes in extreme weather and climate events, based on projections to the mid- to late 21st century. These do not take into account any changes or developments in adaptive capacity. Examples of all entries are to be found in chapters in the full Assessment (see source at top of columns). The first two columns of the table (shaded yellow) are taken directly from the Working Group I Fourth Assessment (Table SPM-2). The likelihood estimates in Column 2 relate to the phenomena listed in Column 1.  D. Current knowledge about responding to climate change Some adaptation is occurring now, to observed and projected future climate change, but on a limited basis. There is growing evidence since the IPCC Third Assessment of human activity to adapt to observed and anticipated climate change. For example, climate change is considered in the design of infrastructure projects such as coastal defence in the Maldives and The Netherlands, and the Confederation Bridge in Canada. Other examples include prevention of glacial lake outburst flooding in Nepal, and policies and strategies such as water management in Australia and government responses to heatwaves in, for example, some European countries [7.6, 8.2, 8.6, 17.ES, 17.2, 16.5, 11.5].  The array of potential adaptive responses available to human societies is very large, ranging from purely technological (e.g., sea defences), through behavioural (e.g., altered food and recreational choices), to managerial (e.g., altered farm practices) and to policy (e.g., planning regulations). While most technologies and strategies are known and developed in some countries, the assessed literature does not indicate how effective various options13 are at fully reducing risks, particularly at higher levels of warming and related impacts, and for vulnerable groups. In addition, there are formidable environmental, economic, informational, social, attitudinal and behavioural barriers to the implementation of adaptation. For developing countries, availability of resources and building adaptive capacity are particularly important [see Sections 5 and 6 in Chapters 3-16; also 17.2, 17.4]. Adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change, and especially not over the long term as most impacts increase in magnitude [Figure SPM.2].  Adaptation will be necessary to address impacts resulting from the warming which is already unavoidable due to past emissions.  Vulnerability to climate change can be exacerbated by the presence of other stresses.  Past emissions are estimated to involve some unavoidable warming (about a further 0.6�C by the end of the century relative to 1980-1999) even if atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remain at 2000 levels (see Working Group I Fourth Assessment). There are some impacts for which adaptation is the only available and appropriate response. An indication of these impacts can be seen in Figure SPM.2. A wide array of adaptation options is available, but more extensive adaptation than is currently occurring is required to reduce vulnerability to future climate change. There are barriers, limits and costs, but these are not fully understood.  Non-climate stresses can increase vulnerability to climate change by reducing resilience and can also reduce adaptive capacity because of resource deployment to competing needs. For example, current stresses on some coral reefs include marine pollution and chemical runoff from agriculture as well as increases in water temperature and ocean acidification. Vulnerable regions face multiple stresses that affect their exposure and sensitivity as well as their capacity to adapt. These stresses arise from, for example, current climate hazards, poverty and unequal access to resources, food insecurity, trends in economic globalisation, conflict, and incidence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS [7.4, 8.3, 17.3, 20.3]. Adaptation measures are seldom undertaken in response to climate change alone but can be integrated within, for example, water resource management, coastal defence and risk-reduction strategies [17.2, 17.5].  Impacts are expected to increase with increases in global average temperature, as indicated in Figure SPM.2. Although many early impacts of climate change can be effectively addressed through adaptation, the options for successful adaptation diminish and the associated costs increase with increasing climate change. At present we do not have a clear picture of the limits to adaptation, or the cost, partly because effective adaptation measures are highly dependent on specific, geographical and climate risk factors as well as institutional, political and financial constraints [7.6, 17.2, 17.4].  Future vulnerability depends not only on climate change but also on development pathway. An important advance since the IPCC Third Assessment has been the completion of impacts studies for a range of different development pathways taking into account not only projected climate change but also projected social and economic changes. Most have been based on characterisations of population and income level drawn from the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (see Endbox 3) [2.4].   These studies show that the projected impacts of climate change can vary greatly due to the development pathway assumed. For example, there may be large differences in regional population, income and technological development under alternative scenarios, which are often a strong determinant of the level of vulnerability to climate change [2.4].  concentrations of greenhouse gases are stabilised. Although these studies do not take full account of uncertainties in projected climate under stabilisation, they nevertheless provide indications of damages avoided or vulnerabilities and risks reduced for different amounts of emissions reduction [2.4, T20.6].  To illustrate, in a number of recent studies of global impacts of climate change on food supply, risk of coastal flooding and water scarcity, the projected number of people affected is considerably greater under the A2-type scenario of development (characterised by relatively low per capita income and large population growth) than under other SRES futures [T20.6]. This difference is largely explained, not by differences in changes of climate, but by differences in vulnerability [T6.6]. Sustainable development14 can reduce vulnerability to climate change, and climate change could impede nations' abilities to achieve sustainable development pathways. Sustainable development can reduce vulnerability to climate change by enhancing adaptive capacity and increasing resilience. At present, however, few plans for promoting sustainability have explicitly included either adapting to climate change impacts, or promoting adaptive capacity [20.3].  A portfolio of adaptation and mitigation measures can diminish the risks associated with climate change. Even the most stringent mitigation efforts cannot avoid further impacts of climate change in the next few decades, which makes adaptation essential, particularly in addressing near-term impacts. Unmitigated climate change would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt [20.7]. This suggests the value of a portfolio or mix of strategies that includes mitigation, adaptation, technological development (to enhance both adaptation and mitigation) and research (on climate science, impacts, adaptation and mitigation). Such portfolios could combine policies with incentive-based approaches, and actions at all levels from the individual citizen through to national governments and international organisations [18.1, 18.5].  On the other hand, it is very likely that climate change can slow the pace of progress towards sustainable development, either directly through increased exposure to adverse impact or indirectly through erosion of the capacity to adapt. This point is clearly demonstrated in the sections of the sectoral and regional chapters of this report that discuss the implications for sustainable development [See Section 7 in Chapters 3-8, 20.3, 20.7].  One way of increasing adaptive capacity is by introducing the consideration of climate change impacts in development planning [18.7], for example, by: � including adaptation measures in land-use planning and infrastructure design [17.2]; � including measures to reduce vulnerability in existing disaster risk reduction strategies [17.2, 20.8].  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are one measure of progress towards sustainable development. Over the next half-century, climate change could impede achievement of the MDGs [20.7]. Many impacts can be avoided, reduced or delayed by mitigation. A small number of impact assessments have now been completed for scenarios in which future atmospheric  E. Systematic observing and research needs Although the science to provide policymakers with information about climate change impacts and adaptation potential has improved since the Third Assessment, it still leaves many important questions to be answered. The chapters of the Working Group II Fourth Assessment include a number of judgements about priorities for further observation and research, and this advice should be considered seriously (a list of these recommendations is given in the Technical Summary Section TS-6). Endbox 1. Definitions of key terms Climate change in IPCC usage refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs from that in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, where climate change refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods. Adaptive capacity is the ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences. Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.  Endbox 2. Communication of Uncertainty in the Working Group II Fourth Assessment  A set of terms to describe uncertainties in current knowledge is common to all parts of the IPCC Fourth Assessment.  Description of confidence Authors have assigned a confidence level to the major statements in the Summary for Policymakers on the basis of their assessment of current knowledge, as follows:  Terminology Very high confidence High confidence Medium confidence Low confidence Very low confidence  Degree of confidence in being correct At least 9 out of 10 chance of being correct About 8 out of 10 chance About 5 out of 10 chance About 2 out of 10 chance Less than a 1 out of 10 chance  Description of likelihood Likelihood refers to a probabilistic assessment of some well-defined outcome having occurred or occurring in the future, and may be based on quantitative analysis or an elicitation of expert views. In the Summary for Policymakers, when authors evaluate the likelihood of certain outcomes, the associated meanings are:  Terminology Virtually certain Very likely Likely About as likely as not Unlikely Very unlikely Exceptionally unlikely  Likelihood of the occurrence/ outcome >99% probability of occurrence 90 to 99% probability 66 to 90% probability 33 to 66% probability 10 to 33% probability 1 to 10% probability <1% probability    Summary for Policymakers Endbox 3. The Emissions Scenarios of the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B) (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply to all energy supply and end use technologies). A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self reliance and preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously increasing population. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological change more fragmented and slower than other storylines. B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same global population, that peaks in midcentury and declines thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives. B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population, at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented towards environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels. An illustrative scenario was chosen for each of the six scenario groups A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1 and B2. All should be considered equally sound. The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol.

IPCC-2007-4.txt,"Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Summary for Policymakers A. Introduction 1. The Working Group III contribution to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) focuses on new literature on the scientific, technological, environmental, economic and social aspects of mitigation of climate change, published since the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) and the Special Reports on CO2 Capture and Storage (SRCCS) and on Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System (SROC). The following summary is organised into six sections after this introduction: � Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trends � Mitigation in the short and medium term, across different economic sectors (until 2030) � Mitigation in the long-term (beyond 2030) � Policies, measures and instruments to mitigate climate change � Sustainable development and climate change mitigation � Gaps in knowledge. References to the corresponding chapter sections are indicated at each paragraph in square brackets. An explanation of terms, acronyms and chemical symbols used in this SPM can be found in the glossary to the main report. B. Greenhouse gas emission trends 2. Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have grown since pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70% between 1970 and 2004 (high agreement, much evidence). � Since pre-industrial times, increasing emissions of GHGs due to human activities have led to a marked increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations [1.3; Working Group I SPM]. � Between 1970 and 2004, global emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, weighted by their global warming potential (GWP), have increased by 70% (24%  between 1990 and 2004), from 28.7 to 49 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (GtCO2-eq) (see Figure SPM.1). The emissions of these gases have increased at different rates. CO2 emissions have grown between 1970 and 2004 by about 80% (28% between 1990 and 2004) and represented 77% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2004. � The largest growth in global GHG emissions between 1970 and 2004 has come from the energy supply sector (an increase of 145%). The growth in direct emissions from transport in this period was 120%, industry 65% and land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) 40%. Between 1970 and 1990 direct emissions from agriculture grew by 27% and from buildings by 26%, and the latter remained at approximately at 1990 levels thereafter. However, the buildings sector has a high level of electricity use and hence the total of direct and indirect emissions in this sector is much higher (75%) than direct emissions [1.3, 6.1, 11.3, Figures 1.1 and 1.3]. � The effect on global emissions of the decrease in global energy intensity (-33%) during 1970 to 2004 has been smaller than the combined effect of global per capita income growth (77 %) and global population growth (69%); both drivers of increasing energy-related CO2 emissions (Figure SPM.2). The long-term trend of a declining carbon intensity of energy supply reversed after 2000. Differences in terms of per capita income, per capita emissions, and energy intensity among countries remain significant. (Figure SPM.3). In 2004 UNFCCC Annex I countries held a 20% share in world population, produced 57% of world Gross Domestic Product based on Purchasing Power Parity (GDPppp), and accounted for 46% of global GHG emissions (Figure SPM.3) [1.3]. � The emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODS) controlled under the Montreal Protocol, which are also GHGs, have declined significantly since the 1990s. By 2004 the emissions of these gases were about 20% of their 1990 level [1.3]. � A range of policies, including those on climate change, energy security, and sustainable development, have been effective in reducing GHG emissions in different sectors and many countries. The scale of such measures, however, has not yet been large enough to counteract the global growth in emissions [1.3, 12.2].    Figure SPM.1: Global Warming Potential (GWP) weighted global greenhouse gas emissions 1970-2004. 100 year GWPs from IPCC 1996 (SAR) were used to convert emissions to CO2-eq. (cf. UNFCCC reporting guidelines). CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6 from all sources are included. The two CO2 emission categories reflect CO2 emissions from energy production and use (second from bottom) and from land use changes (third from the bottom) [Figure 1.1a]. Notes: 1. Other N2O includes industrial processes, deforestation/savannah burning, waste water and waste incineration. 2. Other is CH4 from industrial processes and savannah burning. 3. Including emissions from bioenergy production and use 4. CO2 emissions from decay (decomposition) of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation and CO2 from peat fires and decay of drained peat soils. 5. As well as traditional biomass use at 10% of total, assuming 90% is from sustainable biomass production. Corrected for 10% carbon of biomass that is assumed to remain as charcoal after combustion. 6. For large-scale forest and scrubland biomass burning averaged data for 1997-2002 based on Global Fire Emissions Data base satellite data. 7. Cement production and natural gas flaring. 8. Fossil fuel use includes emissions from feedstocks. 3. With current climate change mitigation policies and related sustainable development practices, global GHG emissions will continue to grow over the next few decades (high agreement, much evidence). � The SRES (non-mitigation) scenarios project an increase of baseline global GHG emissions by a range of 9.7 GtCO2-eq to 36.7 GtCO2-eq (25-90%) between 2000 and 2030 (Box SPM.1 and Figure SPM.4). In these scenarios, fossil fuels are projected to maintain their dominant position in the global energy mix to 2030 and beyond. Hence CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2030 from energy use are projected to grow 40 to 110% over that period. Two thirds to three quarters of this increase in energy CO2 emissions is projected to come from nonAnnex I regions, with their average per capita energy CO2 emissions being projected to remain substantially lower (2.8-5.1 tCO2/cap) than those in Annex I regions (9.6-15.1 tCO2/cap) by 2030. According to SRES scenarios, their economies are projected to have a lower energy use per unit of GDP (6.2 � 9.9 MJ/US$ GDP) than that of non-Annex I countries (11.0 � 21.6 MJ/US$ GDP). [1.3, 3.2]  Figure SPM.4: Global GHG emissions for 2000 and projected baseline emissions10 for 2030 and 2100 from IPCC SRES and the post-SRES literature. The figure provides the emissions from the six illustrative SRES scenarios. It also provides the frequency distribution of the emissions in the post-SRES scenarios (5th, 25th, median, 75th, 95th percentile), as covered in Chapter 3. F-gases cover HFCs, PFCs and SF6 [1.3, 3.2, Figure 1.7].  4. Baseline emissions scenarios published since SRES10, are comparable in range to those presented in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (25- 135 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2100, see Figure SPM.4) (high agreement, much evidence). � Studies since SRES used lower values for some drivers for emissions, notably population projections. However, for those studies incorporating these new population projections, changes in other drivers, such as economic growth, resulted in little change in overall emission levels. Economic growth projections for Africa, Latin America and the Middle East to 2030 in post-SRES baseline scenarios are lower than in SRES, but this has only minor effects on global economic growth and overall emissions [3.2].  � Representation of aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions, including sulphur dioxide, black carbon, and organic carbon, which have a net cooling effect11 has improved. Generally, they are projected to be lower than reported in SRES [3.2]. � Available studies indicate that the choice of exchange rate for GDP (MER or PPP) does not appreciably affect the projected emissions, when used consistently12. The differences, if any, are small compared to the uncertainties caused by assumptions on other parameters in the scenarios, e.g. technological change [3.2].  10 Baseline scenarios do not include additional climate policy above current ones; more recent studies differ with respect to UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol inclusion. 11 See AR4 WG I report, Chapter 10.2. 12 Since TAR, there has been a debate on the use of different exchange rates in emission scenarios. Two metrics are used to compare GDP between countries. Use of MER is preferable for analyses involving internationally traded products. Use of PPP, is preferable for analyses involving comparisons of income between countries at very different stages of development. Most of the monetary units in this report are expressed in MER. This reflects the large majority of emissions mitigation literature that is calibrated in MER. When monetary units are expressed in PPP, this is denoted by GDPppp.    Box SPM.1: The emission scenarios of the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies.

The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol. This box summarizing the SRES scenarios is taken from the Third Assessment Report and has been subject to prior line by line approval by the Panel. Box SPM.2: Mitigation potential and analytical approaches The concept of ""mitigation potential"" has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission baselines, for a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigation potential is further differentiated in terms of ""market potential"" and ""economic potential"". Market potential is the mitigation potential based on private costs and private discount rates13, which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in place, noting that barriers limit actual uptake [2.4].  Economic potential is the mitigation potential, which takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates14, assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and measures and barriers are removed [2.4]. Studies of market potential can be used to inform policy makers about mitigation potential with existing policies and barriers, while studies of economic potentials show what might be achieved if appropriate new and additional policies were put into place to remove barriers and include social costs and benefits. The economic potential is therefore generally greater than the market potential. Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. There are two broad classes � ""bottom-up"" and ""topdown"" approaches, which primarily have been used to assess the economic potential. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options, emphasizing specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Sector estimates have been aggregated, as in the TAR, to provide an estimate of global mitigation potential for this assessment. Top-down studies assess the economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about mitigation options and capture macro-economic and market feedbacks. Bottom-up and top-down models have become more similar since the TAR as top-down models have incorporated more technological mitigation options and bottom-up models have incorporated more macroeconomic and market feedbacks as well as adopting barrier analysis into their model structures. Bottom-up studies in particular are useful for the assessment of specific policy options at sectoral level, e.g. options for improving energy efficiency, while top-down studies are useful for assessing cross-sectoral and economy-wide climate change policies, such as carbon taxes and stabilization policies. However, current bottom-up and top-down studies of economic potential have limitations in considering life-style choices, and in including all externalities such as local air pollution. They have limited representation of some regions, countries, sectors, gases, and barriers. The projected mitigation costs do not take into account potential benefits of avoided climate change. Box SPM.3: Assumptions in studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a global least cost approach to mitigation portfolios and with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and thus perfect implementation of mitigation measures throughout the 21st century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g. land-use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower baselines, use of revenues from carbon taxes and auctioned permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider climate benefits and generally also co-benefits of mitigation measures, or equity issues. Box SPM.4: Modelling induced technological change Relevant literature implies that policies and measures may induce technological change. Remarkable progress has been achieved in applying approaches based on induced technological change to stabilisation studies; however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that adopt these approaches, projected costs for a given stabilization level are reduced; the reductions are greater at lower stabilisation levels.   C. Mitigation in the short and medium term (until 2030) 5. Both bottom-up and top-down studies indicate that there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global GHG emissions over the coming decades, that could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below current levels (high agreement, much evidence). Uncertainties in the estimates are shown as ranges in the tables below to reflect the ranges of baselines, rates of technological change and other factors that are specific to the different approaches. Furthermore, uncertainties also arise from the limited information for global coverage of countries, sectors and gases. Bottom-up studies: � In 2030, the economic potential estimated for this assessment from bottom-up approaches (see Box SPM.2) is presented in Table SPM.1 below and Figure SPM.5A. For reference: emissions in 2000 were equal to 43 GtCO2-eq. [11.3]:  � Studies suggest that mitigation opportunities with net negative costs15 have the potential to reduce emissions by around 6 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2030. Realizing these requires dealing with implementation barriers [11.3]. � No one sector or technology can address the entire mitigation challenge. All assessed sectors contribute to the total (see Figure SPM.6). The key mitigation technologies and practices for the respective sectors are shown in Table SPM 3 [4.3, 4.4, 5.4, 6.5, 7.5, 8.4, 9.4, 10.4]. Top-down studies: � Top-down studies calculate an emission reduction for 2030 as presented in Table SPM.2 below and Figure SPM.5B. The global economic potentials found in the top-down studies are in line with bottom-up studies (see Box SPM.2), though there are considerable differences at the sectoral level [3.6]. � The estimates in Table SPM.2 were derived from stabilization scenarios, i.e., runs towards long-run stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentration [3.6].  Figure SPM.6: Estimated sectoral economic potential for global mitigation for different regions as a function of carbon price in 2030 from bottom-up studies, compared to the respective baselines assumed in the sector assessments. A full explanation of the derivation of this figure is found in Section 11.3. Notes: 1. The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector. 2. The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels. 3. Sectors used different baselines. For industry the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport the WEO 2004 baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces were used to construct a waste specific baseline, agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces. 4. Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included [5.4]. 5. Categories excluded are: non-CO2 emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and cogeneration in energy supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewater treatment, emission reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underestimation of the total economic potential from these emissions is of the order of 10-15%.  6. In 2030 macro-economic costs for multi-gas mitigation, consistent with emissions trajectories towards stabilization between 445 and 710 ppm CO2-eq, are estimated at between a 3% decrease of global GDP and a small increase, compared to the baseline (see Table SPM.4). However, regional costs may differ significantly from global averages (high agreement, medium evidence) (see Box SPM.3 for the methodologies and assumptions of these results). � The majority of studies conclude that reduction of GDP relative to the GDP baseline increases with the stringency of the stabilization target. � Depending on the existing tax system and spending of the revenues, modelling studies indicate that costs may be substantially lower under the assumption that revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned permits under an emission trading system are used to promote lowcarbon technologies or reform of existing taxes [11.4].  � Studies that assume the possibility that climate change policy induces enhanced technological change also give lower costs. However, this may require higher upfront investment in order to achieve costs reductions thereafter (see Box SPM.4) [3.3, 3.4, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6]. � Although most models show GDP losses, some show GDP gains because they assume that baselines are non-optimal and mitigation policies improve market efficiencies, or they assume that more technological change may be induced by mitigation policies. Examples of market inefficiencies include unemployed resources, distortionary taxes and/or subsidies [3.3, 11.4]. � A multi-gas approach and inclusion of carbon sinks generally reduces costs substantially compared to CO2 emission abatement only [3.3]. � Regional costs are largely dependent on the assumed stabilization level and baseline scenario. The allocation regime is also important, but for most countries to a lesser extent than the stabilization level [11.4, 13.3].  Notes: a) For a given stabilization level, GDP reduction would increase over time in most models after 2030. Long-term costs also become more uncertain. [Figure 3.25] b) Results based on studies using various baselines. c) Studies vary in terms of the point in time stabilization is achieved; generally this is in 2100 or later. d) This is global GDP based market exchange rates. e) The median and the 10th and 90th percentile range of the analyzed data are given. f) The calculation of the reduction of the annual growth rate is based on the average reduction during the period till 2030 that would result in the indicated GDP decrease in 2030. g) The number of studies that report GDP results is relatively small and they generally use low baselines.  7. Changes in lifestyle and behaviour patterns can contribute to climate change mitigation across all sectors. Management practices can also have a positive role (high agreement, medium evidence). � Lifestyle changes can reduce GHG emissions. Changes in lifestyles and consumption patterns that emphasize resource conservation can contribute to developing a low-carbon economy that is both equitable and sustainable [4.1, 6.7]. � Education and training programmes can help overcome barriers to the market acceptance of energy efficiency, particularly in combination with other measures [Table 6.6]. � Changes in occupant behaviour, cultural patterns and consumer choice and use of technologies can result in considerable reduction in CO2 emissions related to energy use in buildings [6.7]. � Transport Demand Management, which includes urban planning (that can reduce the demand for travel) and provision of information and educational techniques (that can reduce car usage and lead to an efficient driving style) can support GHG mitigation [5.1]. � In industry, management tools that include staff training, reward systems, regular feedback, documentation of existing practices can help overcome industrial organization barriers, reduce energy use, and GHG emissions [7.3].  � Including co-benefits other than health, such as increased energy security, and increased agricultural production and reduced pressure on natural ecosystems, due to decreased tropospheric ozone concentrations, would further enhance cost savings [11.8]. � Integrating air pollution abatement and climate change mitigation policies offers potentially large cost reductions compared to treating those policies in isolation [11.8]. 9. Literature since TAR confirms that there may be effects from Annex I countries' action on the global economy and global emissions, although the scale of carbon leakage remains uncertain (high agreement, medium evidence). � Fossil fuel exporting nations (in both Annex I and nonAnnex I countries) may expect, as indicated in TAR16, lower demand and prices and lower GDP growth due to mitigation policies. The extent of this spill over17 depends strongly on assumptions related to policy decisions and oil market conditions [11.7]. � Critical uncertainties remain in the assessment of carbon leakage18. Most equilibrium modelling support the conclusion in the TAR of economy-wide leakage from Kyoto action in the order of 5-20%, which would be less if competitive low-emissions technologies were effectively diffused [11.7] .  8. While studies use different methodologies, in all analyzed world regions near-term health co-benefits from reduced air pollution as a result of actions to reduce GHG emissions can be substantial and may offset a substantial fraction of mitigation costs (high agreement, much evidence).  10. New energy infrastructure investments in developing countries, upgrades of energy infrastructure in industrialized countries, and policies that promote energy security, can, in many cases, create opportunities to achieve GHG emission reductions19 compared to baseline scenarios. Additional co-benefits are country-  specific but often include air pollution abatement, balance of trade improvement, provision of modern energy services to rural areas and employment (high agreement, much evidence). � Future energy infrastructure investment decisions, expected to total over 20 trillion US$20 between now and 2030, will have long term impacts on GHG emissions, because of the long life-times of energy plants and other infrastructure capital stock. The widespread diffusion of low-carbon technologies may take many decades, even if early investments in these technologies are made attractive. Initial estimates show that returning global energy-related CO2 emissions to 2005 levels by 2030 would require a large shift in the pattern of investment, although the net additional investment required ranges from negligible to 5-10% [4.1, 4.4, 11.6]. � It is often more cost-effective to invest in end-use energy efficiency improvement than in increasing energy supply to satisfy demand for energy services. Efficiency improvement has a positive effect on energy security, local and regional air pollution abatement, and employment [4.2, 4.3, 6.5, 7.7, 11.3, 11.8]. � Renewable energy generally has a positive effect on energy security, employment and on air quality. Given costs relative to other supply options, renewable electricity, which accounted for 18% of the electricity supply in 2005, can have a 30-35% share of the total electricity supply in 2030 at carbon prices up to 50 US$/tCO2-eq [4.3, 4.4, 11.3, 11.6, 11.8]. � The higher the market prices of fossil fuels, the more low-carbon alternatives will be competitive, although price volatility will be a disincentive for investors. Higher priced conventional oil resources, on the other hand, may be replaced by high carbon alternatives such as from oil sands, oil shales, heavy oils, and synthetic fuels from coal and gas, leading to increasing GHG emissions, unless production plants are equipped with CCS [4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5]. � Given costs relative to other supply options, nuclear power, which accounted for 16% of the electricity supply in 2005, can have an 18% share of the total electricity supply in 2030 at carbon prices up to 50 US$/tCO2-eq, but safety, weapons proliferation and waste remain as constraints [4.2, 4.3, 4.4]21. � CCS in underground geological formations is a new technology with the potential to make an important contribution to mitigation by 2030. Technical, economic and regulatory developments will affect the actual contribution [4.3, 4.4, 7.3].  11. There are multiple mitigation options in the transport sector19, but their effect may be counteracted by growth in the sector. Mitigation options are faced with many barriers, such as consumer preferences and lack of policy frameworks (medium agreement, medium evidence). � Improved vehicle efficiency measures, leading to fuel savings, in many cases have net benefits (at least for light-duty vehicles), but the market potential is much lower than the economic potential due to the influence of other consumer considerations, such as performance and size. There is not enough information to assess the mitigation potential for heavy-duty vehicles. Market forces alone, including rising fuel costs, are therefore not expected to lead to significant emission reductions [5.3, 5.4]. � Biofuels might play an important role in addressing GHG emissions in the transport sector, depending on their production pathway. Biofuels used as gasoline and diesel fuel additives/substitutes are projected to grow to 3% of total transport energy demand in the baseline in 2030. This could increase to about 5-10%, depending on future oil and carbon prices, improvements in vehicle efficiency and the success of technologies to utilise cellulose biomass [5.3, 5.4]. � Modal shifts from road to rail and to inland and coastal shipping and from low-occupancy to high-occupancy passenger transportation22, as well as land-use, urban planning and non-motorized transport offer opportunities for GHG mitigation, depending on local conditions and policies [5.3, 5.5]. � Medium term mitigation potential for CO2 emissions from the aviation sector can come from improved fuel efficiency, which can be achieved through a variety of means, including technology, operations and air traffic management. However, such improvements are expected to only partially offset the growth of aviation emissions. Total mitigation potential in the sector would also need to account for non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation emissions [5.3, 5.4]. � Realizing emissions reductions in the transport sector is often a co-benefit of addressing traffic congestion, air quality and energy security [5.5]. 12. Energy efficiency options19 for new and existing buildings could considerably reduce CO2 emissions with net economic benefit. Many barriers exist against tapping this potential, but there are also large co-benefits (high agreement, much evidence). � By 2030, about 30% of the projected GHG emissions in the building sector can be avoided with net economic benefit [6.4, 6.5].   � Energy efficient buildings, while limiting the growth of CO2 emissions, can also improve indoor and outdoor air quality, improve social welfare and enhance energy security [6.6, 6.7]. � Opportunities for realising GHG reductions in the building sector exist worldwide. However, multiple barriers make it difficult to realise this potential. These barriers include availability of technology, financing, poverty, higher costs of reliable information, limitations inherent in building designs and an appropriate portfolio of policies and programs [6.7, 6.8]. � The magnitude of the above barriers is higher in the developing countries and this makes it more difficult for them to achieve the GHG reduction potential of the building sector [6.7]. 13. The economic potential in the industrial sector19 is predominantly located in energy intensive industries. Full use of available mitigation options is not being made in either industrialized or developing nations (high agreement, much evidence). � Many industrial facilities in developing countries are new and include the latest technology with the lowest specific emissions. However, many older, inefficient facilities remain in both industrialized and developing countries. Upgrading these facilities can deliver significant emission reductions [7.1, 7.3, 7.4]. � The slow rate of capital stock turnover, lack of financial and technical resources, and limitations in the ability of firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, to access and absorb technological information are key barriers to full use of available mitigation options [7.6].  � There is no universally applicable list of mitigation practices; practices need to be evaluated for individual agricultural systems and settings [8.4]. � Biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops can be an important bioenergy feedstock, but its contribution to mitigation depends on demand for bioenergy from transport and energy supply, on water availability, and on requirements of land for food and fibre production. Widespread use of agricultural land for biomass production for energy may compete with other land uses and can have positive and negative environmental impacts and implications for food security [8.4, 8.8]. 15. Forest-related mitigation activities can considerably reduce emissions from sources and increase CO2 removals by sinks at low costs19, and can be designed to create synergies with adaptation and sustainable development (high agreement, much evidence)23. � About 65% of the total mitigation potential (up to 100 US$/tCO2-eq) is located in the tropics and about 50% of the total could be achieved by reducing emissions from deforestation [9.4]. � Climate change can affect the mitigation potential of the forest sector (i.e., native and planted forests) and is expected to be different for different regions and subregions, both in magnitude and direction [9.5]. � Forest-related mitigation options can be designed and implemented to be compatible with adaptation, and can have substantial co-benefits in terms of employment, income generation, biodiversity and watershed conservation, renewable energy supply and poverty alleviation [9.5, 9.6, 9.7].  14. Agricultural practices collectively can make a significant contribution at low cost19 to increasing soil carbon sinks, to GHG emission reductions, and by contributing biomass feedstocks for energy use (medium agreement, medium evidence). � A large proportion of the mitigation potential of agriculture (excluding bioenergy) arises from soil carbon sequestration, which has strong synergies with sustainable agriculture and generally reduces vulnerability to climate change [8.4, 8.5, 8.8]. � Stored soil carbon may be vulnerable to loss through both land management change and climate change [8.10]. � Considerable mitigation potential is also available from reductions in methane and nitrous oxide emissions in some agricultural systems [8.4, 8.5].  16. Post-consumer waste24 is a small contributor to global GHG emissions25 (<5%), but the waste sector can positively contribute to GHG mitigation at low cost19 and promote sustainable development (high agreement, much evidence). � Existing waste management practices can provide effective mitigation of GHG emissions from this sector: a wide range of mature, environmentally effective technologies are commercially available to mitigate emissions and provide co-benefits for improved public health and safety, soil protection and pollution prevention, and local energy supply [10.3, 10.4, 10.5]. � Waste minimization and recycling provide important indirect mitigation benefits through the conservation of energy and materials [10.4].   � Lack of local capital is a key constraint for waste and wastewater management in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. Lack of expertise on sustainable technology is also an important barrier [10.6]. 17. Geo-engineering options, such as ocean fertilization to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere, or blocking sunlight by bringing material into the upper atmosphere, remain largely speculative and unproven, and with the risk of unknown side-effects. Reliable cost estimates for these options have not been published (medium agreement, limited evidence) [11.2]. D. Mitigation in the long term (after 2030) 18. In order to stabilize the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, emissions would need to peak and decline thereafter. The lower the stabilization level, the more quickly this peak and decline would need to occur. Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels (see Table SPM.5, and Figure SPM. 8)26 (high agreement, much evidence).  � Recent studies using multi-gas reduction have explored lower stabilization levels than reported in TAR [3.3]. � Assessed studies contain a range of emissions profiles for achieving stabilization of GHG concentrations27. Most of these studies used a least cost approach and include both early and delayed emission reductions (Figure SPM.7) [Box SPM.2]. Table SPM.5 summarizes the required emissions levels for different groups of stabilization concentrations and the associated equilibrium global mean temperature increase28, using the `best estimate' of climate sensitivity (see also Figure SPM.8 for the likely range of uncertainty)29. Stabilization at lower concentration and related equilibrium temperature levels advances the date when emissions need to peak, and requires greater emissions reductions by 2050 [3.3].  Table SPM.5: Characteristics of post-TAR stabilization scenarios [Table TS 2, 3.10]a)  a) The understanding of the climate system response to radiative forcing as well as feedbacks is assessed in detail in the AR4 WGI Report. Feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate change affect the required mitigation for a particular stabilization level of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. These feedbacks are expected to increase the fraction of anthropogenic emissions that remains in the atmosphere as the climate system warms. Therefore, the emission reductions to meet a particular stabilization level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underestimated. b) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3�C [WG 1 SPM]. c) Note that global mean temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global mean temperature at the time of stabilization of GHG concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentrations occurs between 2100 and 2150. d) Ranges correspond to the 15th to 85th percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO2 emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios can be compared with CO2- only scenarios.  Figure SPM.7: Emissions pathways of mitigation scenarios for alternative categories of stabilization levels (Category I to VI as defined in the box in each panel). The path- ways are for CO2 emissions only. Light brown shaded areas give the CO2 emissions for the post-TAR emissions scenarios. Green shaded and hatched areas depict the range of more than 80 TAR stabilization scenarios. Base year emissions may differ between models due to differences in sector and industry coverage. To reach the lower stabilization levels some scenarios deploy removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (negative emissions) using technologies such as biomass energy production utilizing carbon capture and storage. [Figure 3.17]  19. The range of stabilization levels assessed can be achieved by deployment of a portfolio of technologies that are currently available and those that are expected to be commercialised in coming decades. This assumes that appropriate and effective incentives are in place for development, acquisition, deployment and diffusion of technologies and for addressing related barriers (high agreement, much evidence). � The contribution of different technologies to emission reductions required for stabilization will vary over time, region and stabilization level. o Energy efficiency plays a key role across many scenarios for most regions and timescales. o For lower stabilization levels, scenarios put more emphasis on the use of low-carbon energy sources, such as renewable energy and nuclear power, and the use of CO2 capture and storage (CCS). In these scenarios improvements of carbon intensity of energy supply and the whole economy need to be much faster than in the past. o Including non-CO2 and CO2 land-use and forestry mitigation options provides greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness for achieving stabilization. Modern bioenergy could contribute substantially to the share of renewable energy in the mitigation portfolio.   Figure SPM.8: Stabilization scenario categories as reported in Figure SPM.7 (coloured bands) and their relationship to equilibrium global mean temperature change above pre-industrial, using (i) ""best estimate"" climate sensitivity of 3�C (black line in middle of shaded area), (ii) upper bound of likely range of climate sensitivity of 4.5�C (red line at top of shaded area) (iii) lower bound of likely range of climate sensitivity of 2�C (blue line at bottom of shaded area). Coloured shading shows the concentration bands for stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere corresponding to the stabilization scenario categories I to VI as indicated in Figure SPM.7. The data are drawn from AR4 WGI, Chapter 10.8.  o For illustrative examples of portfolios of mitigation options, see figure SPM.9 [3.3, 3.4]. � Investments in and world-wide deployment of lowGHG emission technologies as well as technology improvements through public and private Research,  Development & Demonstration (RD&D) would be required for achieving stabilization targets as well as cost reduction. The lower the stabilization levels, especially those of 550 ppm CO2-eq or lower, the greater the need for more efficient RD&D efforts and investment in new  technologies during the next few decades. This requires that barriers to development, acquisition, deployment and diffusion of technologies are effectively addressed. � Appropriate incentives could address these barriers and help realize the goals across a wide portfolio of technologies. [2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6]. 20. In 205030 global average macro-economic costs for multi-gas mitigation towards stabilization between 710 and 445 ppm CO2-eq, are between a 1% gain to a 5.5% decrease of global GDP (see Table SPM.6). For specific countries and sectors, costs vary considerably from the global average. (See Box SPM.3 and SPM.4 for the methodologies and assumptions and paragraph 5 for explanation of negative costs) (high agreement, medium evidence). 21. Decision-making about the appropriate level of global mitigation over time involves an iterative risk management process that includes mitigation and adaptation, taking into account actual and avoided climate change damages, co-benefits, sustainability, equity, and attitudes to risk. Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation involve balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission reductions now against the corresponding medium-term and long-term climate risks of delay [high agreement, much evidence]. � Limited and early analytical results from integrated analyses of the costs and benefits of mitigation indicate that these are broadly comparable in magnitude, but do not as yet permit an unambiguous determination of an emissions pathway or stabilization level where benefits exceed costs [3.5].  � Integrated assessment of the economic costs and benefits of different mitigation pathways shows that the economically optimal timing and level of mitigation depends upon the uncertain shape and character of the assumed climate change damage cost curve. To illustrate this dependency: o if the climate change damage cost curve grows slowly and regularly, and there is good foresight (which increases the potential for timely adaptation), later and less stringent mitigation is economically justified; o alternatively if the damage cost curve increases steeply, or contains non-linearities (e.g. vulnerability thresholds or even small probabilities of catastrophic events), earlier and more stringent mitigation is economically justified [3.6]. � Climate sensitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation scenarios that aim to meet a specific temperature level. Studies show that if climate sensitivity is high then the timing and level of mitigation is earlier and more stringent than when it is low [3.5, 3.6]. � Delayed emission reductions lead to investments that lock in more emission-intensive infrastructure and development pathways. This significantly constrains the opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels (as shown in Table SPM.5) and increases the risk of more severe climate change impacts [3.4, 3.1, 3.5, 3.6]   E. Policies, measures and instruments to mitigate climate change 22. A wide variety of national policies and instruments are available to governments to create the incentives for mitigation action. Their applicability depends on national circumstances and an understanding of their interactions, but experience from implementation in various countries and sectors shows there are advantages and disadvantages for any given instrument (high agreement, much evidence). � Four main criteria are used to evaluate policies and instruments: environmental effectiveness, cost effectiveness, distributional effects, including equity, and institutional feasibility [13.2]. � All instruments can be designed well or poorly, and be stringent or lax. In addition, monitoring to improve implementation is an important issue for all instruments. General findings about the performance of policies are: [7.9, 12.2,13.2] o Integrating climate policies in broader development policies makes implementation and overcoming barriers easier. o Regulations and standards generally provide some certainty about emission levels. They may be preferable to other instruments when information or other barriers prevent producers and consumers from responding to price signals. However, they may not induce innovations and more advanced technologies. o Taxes and charges can set a price for carbon, but cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions. Literature identifies taxes as an efficient way of internalizing costs of GHG emissions. o Tradable permits will establish a carbon price. The volume of allowed emissions determines their environmental effectiveness, while the allocation of permits has distributional consequences. Fluctuation in the price of carbon makes it difficult to estimate the total cost of complying with emission permits. o Financial incentives (subsidies and tax credits) are frequently used by governments to stimulate the development and diffusion of new technologies. While economic costs are generally higher than for the instruments listed above, they are often critical to overcome barriers. o Voluntary agreements between industry and governments are politically attractive, raise awareness among stakeholders, and have played a role in the evolution of many national policies. The majority of agreements has not achieved significant emissions reductions beyond business as usual. However, some recent agreements, in a few countries, have accelerated the application of best available technology and led to measurable emission reductions.  o Information instruments (e.g. awareness campaigns) may positively affect environmental quality by promoting informed choices and possibly contributing to behavioural change, however, their impact on emissions has not been measured yet. o RD&D can stimulate technological advances, reduce costs, and enable progress toward stabilization. � Some corporations, local and regional authorities, NGOs and civil groups are adopting a wide variety of voluntary actions. These voluntary actions may limit GHG emissions, stimulate innovative policies, and encourage the deployment of new technologies. On their own, they generally have limited impact on the national or regional level emissions [13.4]. � Lessons learned from specific sector application of national policies and instruments are shown in Table SPM.7. 23. Policies that provide a real or implicit price of carbon could create incentives for producers and consumers to significantly invest in low-GHG products, technologies and processes. Such policies could include economic instruments, government funding and regulation (high agreement, much evidence). � An effective carbon-price signal could realize significant mitigation potential in all sectors [11.3, 13.2]. � Modelling studies, consistent with stabilization at around 550 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (see Box SPM.3), show carbon prices rising to 20 to 80 US$/tCO2-eq by 2030 and 30 to 155 US$/tCO2-eq by 2050. For the same stabilization level, studies since TAR that take into account induced technological change lower these price ranges to 5 to 65 US$/tCO2-eq in 2030 and 15 to 130 US$/tCO2-eq in 2050 [3.3, 11.4, 11.5]. � Most top-down, as well as some 2050 bottom-up assessments, suggest that real or implicit carbon prices of 20 to 50 US$/tCO2-eq, sustained or increased over decades, could lead to a power generation sector with low-GHG emissions by 2050 and make many mitigation options in the end-use sectors economically attractive. [4.4,11.6] � Barriers to the implementation of mitigation options are manifold and vary by country and sector. They can be related to financial, technological, institutional, informational and behavioural aspects [4.5, 5.5, 6.7, 7.6, 8.6, 9.6, 10.5].   Table SPM.7: Selected sectoral policies, measures and instruments that have shown to be environmentally effective in the respective sector in at least a number of national cases. 24. Government support through financial contributions, tax credits, standard setting and market creation is important for effective technology development, innovation and deployment. Transfer of technology to developing countries depends on enabling conditions and financing (high agreement, much evidence). � Public benefits of RD&D investments are bigger than  the benefits captured by the private sector, justifying government support of RD&D. � Government funding in real absolute terms for most energy research programmes has been flat or declining for nearly two decades (even after the UNFCCC came into force) and is now about half of the 1980 level [2.7, 3.4, 4.5, 11.5, 13.2].   � Governments have a crucial supportive role in providing appropriate enabling environment, such as, institutional, policy, legal and regulatory frameworks31, to sustain investment flows and for effective technology transfer � without which it may be difficult to achieve emission reductions at a significant scale. Mobilizing financing of incremental costs of low-carbon technologies is important. International technology agreements could strengthen the knowledge infrastructure [13.3]. � The potential beneficial effect of technology transfer to developing countries brought about by Annex I countries action may be substantial, but no reliable estimates are available [11.7]. � Financial flows to developing countries through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects have the potential to reach levels of the order of several billions US$ per year32, which is higher than the flows through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), comparable to the energy oriented development assistance flows, but at least an order of magnitude lower than total foreign direct investment flows. The financial flows through CDM, GEF and development assistance for technology transfer have so far been limited and geographically unequally distributed [12.3, 13.3]. 25. Notable achievements of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol are the establishment of a global response to the climate problem, stimulation of an array of national policies, the creation of an international carbon market and the establishment of new institutional mechanisms that may provide the foundation for future mitigation efforts (high agreement, much evidence). � The impact of the Protocol's first commitment period relative to global emissions is projected to be limited. Its economic impacts on participating Annex-B countries are projected to be smaller than presented in TAR, that showed 0.2-2% lower GDP in 2012 without emissions trading, and 0.1-1.1% lower GDP with emissions trading among Annex-B countries [1.4, 11.4, 13.3]. 26. The literature identifies many options for achieving reductions of global GHG emissions at the international level through cooperation. It also suggests that successful agreements are environmentally effective, cost-effective, incorporate distributional considerations and equity, and are institutionally feasible (high agreement, much evidence). � Greater cooperative efforts to reduce emissions will help to reduce global costs for achieving a given level of mitigation, or will improve environmental effectiveness [13.3]. � Improving, and expanding the scope of, market mechanisms (such as emission trading, Joint  Implementation and CDM) could reduce overall mitigation costs [13.3]. � Efforts to address climate change can include diverse elements such as emissions targets; sectoral, local, subnational and regional actions; RD&D programmes; adopting common policies; implementing development oriented actions; or expanding financing instruments. These elements can be implemented in an integrated fashion, but comparing the efforts made by different countries quantitatively would be complex and resource intensive [13.3]. � Actions that could be taken by participating countries can be differentiated both in terms of when such action is undertaken, who participates and what the action will be. Actions can be binding or non-binding, include fixed or dynamic targets, and participation can be static or vary over time [13.3]. F. Sustainable development and climate change mitigation 27. Making development more sustainable by changing development paths can make a major contribution to climate change mitigation, but implementation may require resources to overcome multiple barriers. There is a growing understanding of the possibilities to choose and implement mitigation options in several sectors to realize synergies and avoid conflicts with other dimensions of sustainable development (high agreement, much evidence). � Irrespective of the scale of mitigation measures, adaptation measures are necessary [1.2]. � Addressing climate change can be considered an integral element of sustainable development policies. National circumstances and the strengths of institutions determine how development policies impact GHG emissions. Changes in development paths emerge from the interactions of public and private decision processes involving government, business and civil society, many of which are not traditionally considered as climate policy. This process is most effective when actors participate equitably and decentralized decision making processes are coordinated [2.2, 3.3, 12.2]. � Climate change and other sustainable development policies are often but not always synergistic. There is growing evidence that decisions about macroeconomic policy, agricultural policy, multilateral development bank lending, insurance practices, electricity market reform, energy security and forest conservation, for example, which are often treated as being apart from  climate policy, can significantly reduce emissions. On the other hand, decisions about improving rural access to modern energy sources for example may not have much influence on global GHG emissions [12.2]. � Climate change policies related to energy efficiency and renewable energy are often economically beneficial, improve energy security and reduce local pollutant emissions. Other energy supply mitigation options can be designed to also achieve sustainable development benefits such as avoided displacement of local populations, job creation, and health benefits [4.5,12.3]. � Reducing both loss of natural habitat and deforestation can have significant biodiversity, soil and water conservation benefits, and can be implemented in a socially and economically sustainable manner. Forestation and bioenergy plantations can lead to restoration of degraded land, manage water runoff, retain soil carbon and benefit rural economies, but could compete with land for food production and may be negative for biodiversity, if not properly designed [9.7, 12.3]. � There are also good possibilities for reinforcing sustainable development through mitigation actions in the waste management, transportation and buildings sectors [5.4, 6.6, 10.5, 12.3]. � Making development more sustainable can enhance both mitigative and adaptive capacity, and reduce emissions and vulnerability to climate change. Synergies between mitigation and adaptation can exist, for example properly designed biomass production, formation of protected areas, land management, energy use in buildings and forestry. In other situations, there may be trade-offs, such as increased GHG emissions due to increased consumption of energy related to adaptive responses [2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 6.9, 7.8, 8.5, 9.5, 11.9, 12.1].  G.

Recommendations on Frameworks for the Financing and Implementation of REDD-plus





 



























Preface
This report presents the outcome of four dialogues on frameworks for the financing and implementation of REDD-plus, which were organized by The Forests Dialogue (TFD) between April and August 2009. This publication is not a research study but reflects the perceptions, opinions and recommendations expressed by the participants of these dialogues. It should be seen in the context of the time frame in which the dialogues were held—when international negotiations on REDD-plus were gearing up ahead of the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen in December 2009. In many cases participants expressed their views in language that reflected ongoing discussions and deliberations on REDD- plus in the international negotiations.
The outcomes of the four dialogues fed directly into the global negotiation process. Particularly important in this light were the recommendations made to the Informal Working Group for the Interim Finance of REDD and at the UNFCCC talks in Bangkok in September/October 2009. Those recommendations form the basis of this publication, which synthesizes the contributions of the forest leaders who participated in the dialogues. The results are presented here in the hope that they will contribute to continuing discussions on the development of REDD-plus, in particular at the national level in countries where REDD-readiness planning is now in full swing.
In this document, “REDD-plus” refers to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, including through forest conservation, the sustainable management of forests, and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks, as set out in Article l.iii.b of the Bali Action Plan.

Key Recommendations for Investing in REDD-plus
CONSENSUS ON FRAMEWORKS FOR THE FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REDD-PLUS
The following recommendations are the main outcome of four TFD dialogues on frameworks for the financing and implementation of REDD- plus. They represent the views of nearly 100 forest leaders from environmental and social groups, businesses, indigenous peoples, scientific and forest-community groups, trade unions, forest owners, governments and international organizations.
FOUNDATIONS FOR REDD-PLUS: SOLID PRINCIPLES AND A FULL RANGE OF FOREST-BASED OPTIONS
1. Base REDD-plus firmly on sustainability principles. REDEFplus finance mechanisms must be sufficiently robust to deal with both in- country and international leakage; use credible reference levels; and achieve verifiable additionality. REDD-plus projects must show:
► ecological integrity—by maintaining or enhancing biodiversity conservation and other forest ecosystem functions, such as the provision of water, food, fuel and fibre
► social integrity—by recognizing, protecting and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities and ensuring that they can develop their livelihoods and share the benefits of REDEFplus
► atmospheric integrity—by leading to real reductions in carbon- dioxide (C02) emissions and to the stabilization of C02 in the atmosphere alongside deep emissions cuts in other sectors in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
► economic integrity—by providing new economic development opportunities based on the total value of forests as a source of multiple goods and ecosystems services, including new and predictable revenues streams that are adequate to support the additional costs of the sustainable management and conservation practices incurred by resource managers, owners and local communities and reinforced by fair and transparent institutional and policy arrangements,
REDD-PLUS FINANCE MECHANISMS MUST BE:
► effective—they must contribute to tangible and independent third-party-verifiable stabilizations of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
► efficient— they must result in ‘value for money and allow both private-sector and public-sector institutions to participate on fair terms
► equitable—at a minimum, they must avoid exposing to greater risk the poor and most marginalized rural communities whose livelihoods depend on forests; avert the distortion of forest products markets; and allow broad participation on equitable terms at the national and international levels,
2. Rian for a full range of forest-based climate-change-mitigation options. REDD-plus must create incentives for the full range of forest- based climate-change mitigation activities, based on the principles and practices of the sustainable management of forests. In addition to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD- plus finance mechanisms must also create incentives for additional action on forest conservation, the sustainable management of forests and the enhancement of carbon stocks, as envisioned in the Bali Action Plan developed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
3. Give priority to biodiversity under threat. Early investment must give priority to the conservation of areas under the greatest threat that have the highest levels of biodiversity.
REDD-PLUS PHASES
4. Phased approach with strong performance-based safeguards. Participants in the TFD dialogues discussed the essential elements of a phased approach, a model for which was introduced in 20C9 in the Meridian Report.1 A phased approach would enable REDD-plus to address the drivers of deforestation at a country level according to country-specific circumstances.
Phase 1 The initial preparation-and-readiness phase would involve the development of national-level REDD-plus strategies, including the identification and prioritization of key policy and institutional capacity-building measures for both state and non-state actors. This would pave the way for investments in phase 2 through the development of systems for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) and the identification of required protocols. Public-sector, private-sector, multilateral and bilateral grants and investment mechanisms such as the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD) and the voluntary carbon market could support this phase.
Phase 2 In an intermediate second phase, enabling policies and measures would be put in place to allow the implementation of REDD- plus and, based on performance, to encourage scaled-up public-sector and private-sector investments in the following areas:
► institutional capacity, forest governance and information
► land-tenure reforms, sustainable forest management, the restoration of degraded forest landscapes, the strengthening of conservation in protected areas, and comm unity-based fire management
► activities outside the forest sector needed to reduce pressure on forests, such as the promotion of certified sustainable agriculture, sustainable biomass energy production, agroforestry, and the enhancement of small-scale agricultural productivity.
Financial resources that could support this phase include voluntary contributions from governments, market-linked and transaction-linked international levies, and the auctioning of emission allowances. Multilateral concessional financing sources such as the Forest Investment Program, as well as bilateral funding, private funding and early market payments, are also options but must be performance-based.
Phase 3 In phase 3, market mechanisms—such as the carbon market— and fund-based mechanisms would deliver performance-based payments based on third-party-verifiable emissions reductions and carbon-stock enhancements. Market policies would be designed with the objectives of creating equitable distribution mechanisms, stabilizing prices, and developing risk-management and credit-management vehicles.
5. Triggers guide the transition from one phase to the next. The eligibility of countries to move from one phase to the next should be based on triggers that are informed by a verification body and help to steer and facilitate processes rather than block them. Triggers would work like referenced indicators and would not constitute an obligation or a checklist. Safeguard policies and criteria for entering the compliance market must apply to both forest nations and donor nations, and also to companies aspiring to enter into REDD-plus arrangements.
6. An operational framework for the phases of REDD-plus maps key outcomes., safeguards, finance mechanisms and triggers. The operational framework summarized in the table below sets out the key features of the three phases of a phased approach to REDD-plus.


FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE
7. Financial stability through public and private funding and country commitments. Stable, reliable and long-term financial flows require strong coordination between public-sector and private-sector donors and investors and robust commitments from both developed and developing countries. Developed countries must be willing to guarantee supportand long-term financing arrangements that depart from business-as-usual models for north-south financial transfers. Developing countries need to commit to policy and institutional changes that focus on the transformation of land-use dynamics, forest governance, and the flow of resources to indigenous peoples and local communities,
8. A portfolio of finance mechanisms. Given the scale of the challenge and as part of a well-designed phased approach, there is a need to move beyond the ""markets versus funds"" debate to accommodate a portfolio that makes optimal and coordinated use of both markets and funds as well as other sources of finance, A broad coalition of public-sector and private-sector institutions will need to provide the necessary upfront investments for phases 1 and 2 according to the capacity of each individual institution; investments will need to include both bilateral and multilateral loans and grants,
9. Additionality of funds. REDD-plus funding must be additional to regular official development assistance funding,
MONITORING, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION AND FINANCIAL ASSURANCE
10. Robust MRV. In all phases of a phased approach, REDE>-plus must have environmental, social and financial safeguards along with robust MRV at the local, national and global levels,
11. Performance-based delivery and safeguards. REDD-plus finance must be predicated on perform an ce-based delivery, including proxy- based performance in phase 2, with appropriate safeguards in all
phases. Phase-3 performance must be underpinned by the independent third-party verification of C02 emissions reductions according to local circumstances in each country. During phase 2, proxies could be overall deforestation or measures such as the implementation of policies and the strengthening, in practice, of the rights of local communities.
12. Social, environmental and financial assessment in addition to carbon monitoring. In all phases, assessment of the performance of REDD-plus activities should incorporate social, environmental and financial indicators in addition to the measurement of carbon performance. Socially, environmentally and financially sound processes, based on adaptive management and learning by doing and with full and effective community participation, will produce secure and tradable carbon assets that are appropriate to the performance-based system that will characterize phase 3. Depending on national circumstances, social and environmental safeguards should be assessed in parallel to MRV to show the extent to which REDD-plus makes progress in these areas.
13. Social, environmental and financial audits could be additional and parallel to MRV. Social, environmental and financial audits must:
be equal in status to other aspects of REDD-plus monitoring simultaneously maintain independence and the possibility of ceding social and environmental audits to a third party be part of improved coordination between relevant government departments be subject to only limited government control prevent excessive transaction costs due to complex intra-agency coordination requirements build on best-practice methodologies encourage engagement with the private sector.
14. Verification of performance on issues of livelihoods, rights, benefit sharing and consultation. Social auditing must include:
provisions for men, women and youth in local communities and among indigenous peoples to engage in the design of REDD-plus mechanisms and to participate in REDD-plus activities
clarity on benefit-sharing arrangements with a view to promoting equity between stakeholders within communities— this does not mean prescribing the benefits but, rather, assuring an adequate distribution mechanism the monitoring of negative impacts with respect to forest- dependent livelihoods
respect for free, prior and informed consent by indigenous peoples and local communities independent third-party verification.
15. Biodiversity and ecosystem services. Environmental auditing must include:
the delivery of ecosystem and biodiversity co-benefits priority for high-biodiversity areas, including early action on forest landscape restoration independent third-party verification.
16. Free, prior and informed consent as a rights issue and as a procedure. Free, prior and informed consent is a right for indigenous peoples. It is also a consultative process and a requirement that applies to other stakeholders, such as local communities and forest owners.
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
17. Building governance through adaptive management, piloting and learning by doing. Actions to strengthen governance arrangements and institutions need to incorporate learning through piloting, adaptive management and knowledge transfer, and focus on progress in key areas such as carbon rights, tenure rights and distribution mechanisms.

18. REDD-plus oversight body under the auspices of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. To ensure viable REDD-plus finance in the long run, a REDEAplus oversight body with technical, financial and administrative responsibilities should be set up under the COP with representation based on United Nations regions. The United Nations Economic and Social Council’s Nine Major Groups’ structure—as found within the United Nations Forum on Forests and the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development—can be a model for inclusive stakeholder participation through legitimate representation,
19. Mandate of the international oversight body and the COP. The REDD- plus oversight body must have the authority to evaluate the eligibility of countries to move from one phase of REDEAplus to the next. The COP could set the priorities, such as caps on the proportion of C02 emissions that Annex I countries may offset,
20. Cross-sectoral approach for national REDD-plus bodies. National REDD-plus coordination bodies must work across the public and private sectors and have a multi-stakeholder membership,
21. Building on the experiences of existing certification, monitoring and verification schemes. REDEAplus mechanisms must build on the experiences gained in the existing voluntary carbon market, particularly with respect to carbon-market accounting, credible standards and certification, At the national level, REDEAplus provisions should make use of existing government regulations and structures and capitalize on existing monitoring and independent third-party verification mechanisms, such as forest certification systems,
22. Standards for accounting and tax codes based on existing practices. Tax-code and financial-accounting standards for carbon transactions and investments in the public and private sectors should be established and should be compliant with existing practices and institutions. Where existing practices and institutions are inadequate, new mechanisms need to be created. At the international level, the International Transaction Log2 should be used to help verily transactions.
23. Structures for dealing with grievances and conflicts. REDD-plus governance structures at both the national and International levels must include independent grievance and conflict-resolution mechanisms.
24. Increased coordination and use of existing instruments. In order to minimize transaction costs, existing forest-based instruments (e g. forest law enforcement and governance—FLEG—processes, voluntary partnership agreements, UN-REDD, the Forest Investment Program, and the FCPF) should be used in preference to setting up a new global mechanism. Efforts should be made to strengthen coordination and collaboration between such instruments.
25. Inclusive and accountable forest management through strong partnerships and active participation. REDD-plus must be underpinned by transparent, inclusive and accountable forest management based on local processes. This demands strong partnerships founded on respect for the rights and active participation of indigenous peoples and local communities, consistent with international obligations and standards such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of indigenous peoples and locally defined measures and legal systems. Of key concern is the clarification and strengthening of tenure, property and carbon rights.
26. Effective and efficient interventions through multi-stakeholder platforms. Where possible, the engagement of stakeholders should build on the many national experiences of stakeholder involvement in FLEG processes. Multi-stakeholder platforms in the REDD-plus planning process will not only contribute to equitable participation and representation, they will ensure a more effective process and more efficient interventions. Multi-stakeholder platforms promote better understanding of the role of each stakeholder group and improved communication between groups and can therefore help to avoid or diminish conflicts.


Introduction
DIALOGUES ON FRAMEWORKS FOR REDD-PLUS FINANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION
REDD-plusas a global mechanism Is under construction and negotiation at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Copenhagen Accord, a product of the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC, gives prominence to REDFYplus, but because it is not legally binding, all eyes are now on COP 16, which will be held in Mexico City in December 2010, The strength of any new accord that may be produced, and the extent to which Annex I countries will commit to legally binding emissions reductions targets, will determine the potential of a future global REDFYplus mechanism.
The successful design and implementation of REDFYplus will depend on a reliable, robust and predictable finance mechanism that is transparent and equitable and enjoys the support of key stakeholder groups. In 2007 and 2008 The Forests Dialogue (TFD) successfully completed a first stream of dialogues under the theme ""Forests and Climate"" with the participation of 275 forest stakeholders. This culminated in the publication of the influential document Beyond REDD: The Role of Forests in Climate Change* In the wake of this dialogue stream there were indications of a need among policymakers for more detailed and specific insights into and recommendations for the possible financial architecture of a future REDD-plus mechanism, TFD responded to this need by organizing a set of dialogues specifically dedicated to the financial aspects of a future operational framework for REDFYplus implementation.
The four TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation took place in 20C9 in the run-up to COP 15 in Copenhagen in December 20C9, The dialogues were held on:
25-26 April in New York, United States, parallel toa session of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF)
19-20 July, in Montreux, Switzerland, after board meetings of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD)

►	5-6	August	in Gland, Switzerland
2-3 September In London, United Kingdom,
Nearly 100 leaders of environmental and social groups, businesses, indigenous peoples, scientific and forest-community groups, trade unions, forest owners, academics, governments and international organizations participated in the dialogues, A list of participants is presented on page 45-46 of this report.
The five guiding principies of Beyond REDD: The Role of Forests in Climate Change formed the foundation of the REDD-plus finance and implementation dialogues. They were:
► Ensure that forest-related climate-change options support sustainable development in both forest-rich and forest-poor countries,
► Tackle the drivers of deforestation that lie outside the forest sector,
► Support transparent, inclusive and accountable forest governance,
► Encourage local processes to clarify and strengthen tenure, property and carbon rights,
► Provide substantial additional funding to build the capacity to put the above principles into practice.
The objectives of the dialogues on REDD-plus finance and implementation were to:
define the challenges and opportunities of finance-mechanism options currently being debated in the international community elaborate on the possible solutions to identified challenges develop recommendations to be considered by leaders in the negotiations leading to COP 15,

Discussions on the development of an operational framework for the phases of REDD-plus provided a structure within which TFD’s specific recommendations on REDD-plus finance and implementation emerged. The recommendations were launched on 1 October 20C9 at UNFCCC talks in Bangkok and received strong interest from negotiators. This report presents the proposed operational framework, the recommendations, and other key points made during the dialogues,
ABOUT THE FORESTS DIALOGUE
TFD is an informal organization that organizes and facilitates stakeholder consultations on a variety of forest-related issues. In the last two years TFD has convened seven international dialogues under the theme of ""Forests and Climate"" that have engaged hundreds of leaders from a broad range of stakeholder groups, TFD is currently holding consultations on REDD-readiness processes through a stream of three field dialogues in Africa and Latin America,
ABOUT THE NORAD PROJECT “SCALING UP VOICES”
The TFD dialogues on REDD-plus finance and implementation were organized as part of the project ""Scaling Up Voices for Influencing a Post- 2012 Climate-change Regime: Shaping Pro-poor REDD Options,"" which is funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) and executed by TFD and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), The objective of the project is to contribute to the delivery of tangible forest-based emissions reductions through national REDD-readiness processes and, ultimately, a post-2012 climate-change regime while directly benefiting the forest-dependent poor and safeguarding environmental values. While the scope of the project is international, it links international and national levels by supporting national REDD-readiness processes. Target groups include civil-society actors, indigenous peoples, the private sector and decision-makers. Outputs include consensus-building, developing knowledge-based links between national and international processes, and international advocacy.
REDD-plus as a Climate Change Mitigation Strategy
Deforestation is defined by the UNFCCC as the direct human-induced conversion of forested land to non-forested land. The UNFCCC does not currently have an agreed definition of forest degradation, but the Food and .Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) coordinates a process that is working on a definition. The concept of REDD was first introduced to the UNFCCC process at COP 11 in 2005 in a submission by the governments of Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica titled Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries and Approaches to Stimulate Action. After a two-year process, during which key methodological issues such as those related to reference levels were addressed successfully, the Bali Action Plan proposed the strengthening of forest-related mitigation action in non-Annex I countries through the ""development of policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries.""
The estimated annual rate of deforestation during the 1290s was 12.9 million hectares, which corresponds to 5.8 gigatonnes (Gt) of atmospheric emissions of C02 per year (FAO, 2006; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). More than 85% of current greenhouse- gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation take place in the tropics, making forests the single most important source of greenhouse- gas emissions in tropical countries (Stern, 2006; FAO, 2005). Estimates of the contribution of deforestation to global greenhouse-gas emissions range from 13% to 17% (van der Wert et al., 2009; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). The total carbon stored in standing forests is estimated to be 4,500 Gt, which is more than the carbon held in the world’s remaining oil stocks and more than the total amount of greenhouse gases currently in the earth’s atmosphere (Stern, 2006). A top priority, therefore, should be to conceive this enormous forest-carbon reservoir and to enhance its capacity to further sequester carbon.
It is widely accepted that atmospheric stability cannot be achieved without taking into account the role of forests. Global C02 emissions will need to peak in the near future and stabilize at a level that minimizes the chance of catastrophic climate change and its associated dramatic and irreversible impacts on ecosystems and societies. Forest-related climate- change mitigation can achieve rapid and cost-effective C(>2 emissions reductions, although it should be additional to mitigation strategies— such as energy efficiency and lowA carbon development—in other sectors. REDD-plus mechanisms will need to address the drivers of deforestation, which vary widely. Many forest nations will require time to establish their strategies for tackling the drivers of deforestation. Governance reform, capacity-building and participatory processes will be extremely important in this effort.
Hundreds of millions of people depend on healthy forests for their livelihoods. The sustainable management of forest resources can contribute to the mitigation of climate change through reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions while simultaneously improving livelihoods for forest-dependent communities, many of whom are among the world’s poorest communities.
Sustainable forest management (SFIvl)4 is equally important in comm unity-based management systems and the private sector and should ensure, among other things, that the interests of communities who depend on forests for their livelihoods are assured and that biodiversity is conserved and ecosystem functions protected. Healthy forests sequester larger amounts of carbon than degraded forests. Forests with high levels of biological diversity are more resilient to perturbation and have the capacity to adapt to environmental change. Sustainably managed natural forests maintain larger carbon pools than do intensively managed forests or monoculture plantations.
According to the UNFCCC there are an estimated 850 million hectares of degraded forest lands. The restoration of these lands could sequester
117 Gt C02-equivalent by 2030, which would be equivalent to 1,5 times the estimated potential savings available from avoided deforestation over the same period. The restoration of degraded forests would also enhance the resilience of ecosystems and forest-dependent communities to climate change, as well as generate employment and contribute to rural economic development,
REDD-PLUS UNDER NEGOTIATION
The Bali Action Plan, an outcome of COP 13 in November 2007, paved the way for negotiations on the bread scope of forest-related climate- change mitigation options. In 2009, discussions on what became known as REDD-plus gathered momentum ahead of COP 15, Methodological issues relevant to REDD-plus implementation—such as the monitoring of carbon stocks, the establishment of reference levels, and issues of additionality, leakage and permanence—were discussed in the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, The Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action presented a first negotiating text on REDD-plus in June 2009, This text allowed parties to the UNFCCCand civil-society actors to respond to and negotiate REDD- plus in the context of the UNFCCC’s principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
Despite the absence of binding emissions reduction targets, the Copenhagen Accord consolidated REDD-plus asan essential element of a future global climate-change mitigation strategy. However, while the Accord called for the immediate establishment of a mechanism that would include REDD-plus, it left open whether REDD-plus would link to the markets and whether future REDD payments could be offset by Annex I countries against emissions reduction targets. In the Accord, developed countries committed to providing funds for climate-change mitigation and adaption ""approaching” US$30 billion in 2010-2012 and US$100 billion per year by 2020; a significant portion of these funds will flow through the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund,
The UNFCCC’s Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action will, among other things, continue to develop a REDD-plus mechanism ahead of COP 16 in December 2010,
The development of REDD-plus is also influenced by the outcomes of other bilateral and multilateral processes, such as the Informal Working Group for the Interim Finance of REDD, National REDD-readiness processes are also under way, some with assistance from UN-REDD and the FCPF, As of 31 January 2010, few Annex I countries had announced their emissions reduction targets.
The TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation formulated the following recommendations for TFD-aligned negotiators at the UNFCCC:
A phased approach should be supported.
The elements of the operational framework should be advocated as the basic requirements for REDD-plus in a post- 2012 climate-change regime.
Involvement in negotiations on REDD-plus design and implementation should continue.
An emphasis is needed on capacity-building; institutions; monitoring, reportingand verification (MRV); and property rights. As part of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAIvlA) or national adaptation programs of action, REDD-plus should be further developed and will require significant legislative and regulatory change. The clarification of rights, including carbon rights, is important,
REDD-plus must not be marginalized within the UNFCCC process in the way that forests and SFM were marginalized in the Kyoto Protocol,
Scope and Principles of REDD-plus
SCOPE OF REDD-PLUS
There was consensus among participants in the TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation that, in order to generate the largest-possible C02 emissions reductions as well as cobenefits, a future REDEAplus regime should reflect the bread set of forest-based climate-change mitigation options listed in paragraph l.b.iii of the Bali Action Plan, Forest cover and rates of deforestation vary widely between countries. The conservation of those primary forests that deliver the greatest mitigation benefits per hectare should receive priority, but competing demands and varying country conditions will require difficult choices and tradeoffs. The inclusion of the broad set of forest-based mitigation options presented in the Bali Action Plan would allow countries with varying rates of deforestation and levels of forest cover to participate in and commit to measures in their forest sectors that result in net carbon gains. Table 2 shows the elements of REDD-plus and their potential roles in the maintenance, restoration or creation of carbon pools at the landscape level.

The broad elements of REDD-plus are:
Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation— activities that protect forests from the threat of conversion or degradation in the immediate or medium term.
►- Conservation of forests—activities that focus on the protection of natural forests, especially primary forests. Special attention is needed on forests that are under protection but which could be threatened byconversion in the future (e.g. due to national or international leakage). The inclusion of consecration ensures that countries with high forest cover and low rates of deforestation can also benefit from REDD-plus mechanisms, ►- SFIvl/sustainable management of forests—actions that safeguard existing carbon stocks in working forests that are managed commercially or by communities while ensuring the economically, ecologically and socially sustainable provision of associated ecosystem goods and services. Such measures guard against long-term decline and, where possible, help to expand carbon stocks, SFM should be implemented as part of coordinated national policies that also include conservation and the restoration of degraded forests,
► Enhancement of carbon stocks—activities at a landscape scale that restore forest ecosystems, enabling them to increase and maintain carbon stocks in such a way that social and ecological integrity is improved,
GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND SCOPE OF REDD-PLUS ARCH ITECTURE
TFD’s focus on the broader scope of REDE>-plus is in line with current use of the term in UNFCCC negotiations. The broader scope will ensure that finance mechanisms for REDE>-plus guarantee the use of forest- related mitigation options to their maximum potential. It will also create incentives for the participation of a maximum range of forest nations, including countries that have high forest cover and low rates of deforestation, which will help to minimize international leakage,
REDE>-plus will require large investments in countries with very specific needs. To ensure that funds are accessible to local actors, flexible approaches are needed. Key questions to be addressed centre on the nature and sources of financial flows and the activities that they might support. A reliable, robust and predictable finance mechanism will be characterized by fairness and transparency and will enjoy the support of all key stakeholder groups.
To contribute to C02 emissions reductions in the forest sector in a sustainable manner, REDD-plus must be:
effective: REDD-plus should contribute to measurable and third-party-verifiable CQs emissions reductions. The creation of ""hotair” under reference levels based on development-path trajectories should be avoided. Similarly, permanence and additionality must be demonstrated.
► efficient: REDD-plus action should generate emissions reductions that are ""value for money” and will encourage both private-sector and public-sector institutions to participate on fair terms. Forest carbon must be investment-friendly.
► equitable: REDE>-plus should be conducted with the full inclusion of forest-dependent poor, including the most marginalized rural communities whose livelihoods depend on forests. At the very least, such people should not be exposed to greater risk. Instead, mechanisms for benefit-sharing and the inclusion of indigenous peoples and local communities should guarantee improved livelihoods with special attention to gender dynamics. The full integration of these principles in the operation of REDD-plus funds and payments is an important prerequisite for the successful implementation of REDE>-plus.
Participants in the TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDE>-plus finance and implementation stressed that REDE>-plus finance must be sufficiently robust to deal with both in-country and international leakage and to achieve verifiable additionality. REDE>-plus projects must lead to real, verifiable C02 abatement and must not result in adverse environmental or social impacts. They must therefore have:
► ecological integrity—by maintaining or enhancing the conservation of biodiversity and other forest ecosystem functions, such as the provision of water, food, fuel and fibre.
► social integrity—by recognizing, protecting and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities and ensuring that such peoples and communities can develop their livelihoods and share the benefits of REDE>-plus.
>- atmospheric integrity—by leading to real reductions in C02 emissions and to the stabilization of C02 in the atmosphere alongside deep emissions cuts in other sectors in line with the recommendations of the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
STARTING POINT OF THE DIALOGUES
The main conclusions of TFD’s publication Beyond REDD: The Role of Forests in Climate Change provided solid ground for participants to discuss the financial architecture of REDD-plus. To ensure the stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of C02, REDE>-plus needs to be an integral part of the post-2012 arrangement on climate change. REDE)- plus can deliver its full C02 mitigation potential if measures are harmonized with policy frameworks that promote not only emissions reductions but also removals through the conservation and sustainable management of forests and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks. REDD-plus also requires developing countries to advance or accelerate coherent sectoral and cross-sectoral strategies that facilitate its implementation. A phased approach would include an interim period in which a series of institutional, legal and educational measures would be implemented, tailored to the specific needs of countries. The success of these measures would depend on effective participatory consultation and the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders—particularly forest-rights’ holders such as indigenous peoples, other forest-dependent communities, individual family forest owners, and small-holders, as well as other categories of land-owners—in decision-making processes. REDD-plus must provide development opportunities for all these groups. The TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation achieved consensus on the idea that the concerns of stakeholders should be accommodated in UNFCCC negotiations and in the subsequent implementation of REDD-plus policies. Some groups stressed the need to ensure the fair distribution of REDD payments. For a majority of forest communities, at least some of their rights to the benefits derived from forests are contested. The interests of such groups must be taken into account not only for ethical reasons but also to avoid conflicts that would jeopardize the contribution of forests to climate- change mitigation.
At the start of the first TFD dialogue in this stream, the following questions were posed:
► Should REDE>-plus financing be market-based or fund-based?
► Should REDD-plus finance mechanisms be developed primarily to incentivise national or sub-national initiatives?
► Should a fund be available to complete the preparatory phase of REDD-plus?
► To what degree should REDD-plus emissions reductions be fungible (interchangeable) with emissions reductions in other sectors?
To what degree should the allocation of REDD-plus payments be subject to the delivery of co-benefits?
Progress was made on most issues, although the question of the fungibility of REDE>-plus emissions reductions was not resolved. Concerns in developing countries over procedures for establishing REDE>-plus reference levels and the implications for related finance mechanisms were placed in the context of capacity requirements. Business representation in the TFD dialogues highlighted the need for the proper clarification of the concepts of carbon stock and flow, uncertainty and discount rates. These, it was made clear, will underpin the decision-making of investors w/ho may provide funding for REDD-plus.
The preparation-and-readiness phase of REDE>-plus (see next chapter) was discussed extensively in light of these and other concerns: it should be used to make countries competitive in future REDE>-plus financing and to ensure the full and informed acceptance of REDE>- plus by local communities.
DEFINITIONS
Effective debates on REDD-plus financing require unambiguous definitions that help clarify contentious issues, around which often form fault-lines of disagreement. Both the proposed inclusion of SFM in REDE>-plus and the need for parties to commit to the principle of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC—see below) for indigenous peoples need clarification. Participants in the TFD dialogues agreed that it is possible to bridge some of the fault-lines by discussing the spirit and intent of these specific terms in context-specific ways. Safeguards can be developed in such a way that they identify the requirements that practices must meet. This is a constructive way around rigid standpoints that demand either the inclusion or exclusion of particular practices.
Sustainable forest management. The idea of SFM is to balance the production of forest goods and services with desired economic, social and environmental outcomes over time and across landscapes. Currently only a small fraction of the global forest estate is under SFIvl regimes. Notwithstanding the scope for improvement and the integration of new insights, SFM practice builds on decades of experience and trial and error in management. The exchange of ideas and insights will contribute to the further development of SFM and its wider uptake. Effective safeguards should be put in place to prevent management practices that are detrimental to social or environmental interests and should help to resolve points of contention in the current debate.
At least seven elements are critical to an understanding of the concept of SFM:
The extent of forest cover and stock maintenance to support social, economic and environmental dimensions.
Biological diversity and ecosystem services.
Forest health and vitality.
The productive functions of forest resources and their sustainability.
The protection of forest ecosystem services and protective functions.
► Socioeconomic functions and the contribution of forest resources to employment, added-value through the processing and marketing of forest produce, energy, trade and investments.
► Enabling legal, policy and institutional arrangements for effective forest governance.
Free, prior and informed consent. Most parties to the UNFCCC stress that the implementation of FPIC, as formulated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), isa matter to be considered by each nation rather than in international processes. Leaders participating in the TFD dialogues, however, emphasized the importance of robust, transparent consultation processes and the early, equitable participation of all stakeholders, particularly indigenous peoples and local communities. There was broad agreement on the importance of FPIC standards to act as a guide for multi-stakeholder consultation processes during the various stages of REDD-plus implementation. Safeguards and systems for MRV must reflect the spirit of FPIC and other principles enshrined in UN DRIP.
Points of discussion on FPIC among stakeholders participating in the TFD dialogues included the following:
► FPIC should be couched in more diplomatic terms that reflect the spirit behind the principle; this would help mitigate the threat of single countries blocking its implementation. Guidelines should be developed for consultation and an early engagement process to help inform investors and buyers about FPIC.
►- Lessons can be learned from countries that have self- supported REDD mechanisms and from developments at the World Bank (where the principle of FPIC is promoted through the FCPF and the Forest Investment Program—FIP) and in UN-REDD.
► FPIC is required at the market level, as part of NAMAs, and at the international level.
► Applying safeguards is about enforcing the precautionary and ""do no harm” principles.
Co-benefits. The issue of co-benefits is centred on social equity and biodiversity objectives and is closely linked to SFM and sustainable development. The following points were raised on the issue:
Loading REDD-plus with too many environmental and community co-benefits can be problematic.
►- The biodiversity section of ministries of environment is often the weakest section of government.

► Forests must be valued for their carbon and social functions as well as their biodiversity.
► Communal ecosystem services and other services are generally undervalued.
► There is a need to link biodiversity offsets with forest-carbon offsets.
► A safeguard is needed under REDD-plus for ""doing no harm” to co-benefits.
► Monitoring and measuring biodiversity change and social impacts could be compulsory for multilateral and bilateral funds in the preparation-and-readiness and policies-and- measures phases of REDD-plus.
Monitoring, reporting and verification. MRV systems should account for more than just carbon gains and monitor more than just forest dynamics; a holistic approach is needed that includes social and environmental criteria. Another possibility is that social and environmental audits are conducted separately to MRV.

Operational Framework for the Phases of REDD-plus
A model for a phased approach to REDD-plus was introduced in 2009 in the Meridian Report5 The operational framework for such a phased approach presented here is the direct outcome of discussion sessions and breakout groups held during the second and third TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDEFplus finance. The framework, which is presented in Table 3, addresses the outcomes, safeguards, financial mechanisms and triggers of each of the three phases of REDD-plus implementation; it represents common ground for dialogue participants.
INTRODUCTION OF THE PHASED APPROACH
A phased approach to REDD-plus, comprising a preparation-and- readiness phase, a policies-and-measures phase, and an implementation phase, would allow the development of country-specific instruments to tackle the drivers of deforestation during an interim period before links to markets are established. Participants in the TFD dialogues agreed that initial phases, while essential, should not be so long as to delay unnecessarily the introduction of performance-based measures in phase 3. A phased approach should encourage flexibility and not aim to generate a single blueprint for all countries. Rather, a phased approach should give countries the ability to design strategies tailored to their specific circumstances and portfolios of funding, which could include both market- based and fund-based finance.
Phase 1: Preparation and readiness
In phase 1, countries would develop strategies that address the drivers of deforestation through a learning-by-doing process that directly meets the needs of local people. Readiness programs should concentrate on forest governance reform, capacity-building and the strengthening of legal systems and law enforcement. Political and institutional governance reform can only be successful through the equitable and effective engagement of stakeholders and the recognition and development of the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. The clarification of land, tenure and carbon rights should be expedited. Robust multi-stakeholder platforms must ensure the effective participation of both state and non-state actors. Particular attention is needed to ensure gender balance and the representation of the most-vulnerable poor. This phase could be supported by public-sector and private-sector funding and by multilateral and bilateral grants and investment mechanisms such as FCPF, UN-REDD and voluntary carbon markets.


Phase 2: Policies and measures
Processes during phase 2 would pave the way for upfront investments through the development of systems for MRV and the identification of required protocols. Countries will develop portfolios of funding using both market-based and fund-based sources. As an intermediate stage, phase 2 should enable the development of the policies and measures needed for performance-based REDD-plus implementation. The drivers of deforestation, as identified in country-specific action plans in phase 1, would need to be addressed and tackled. Scaled-up public-sector and private- sector investments would be needed in the areas of institutional capacity, forest governance and land-tenure reform. Funding could be obtained through voluntary contributions by governments, market-linked and transaction-linked international levies, and the auctioning of emission allowances. Multilateral concessional financing sources such as the FIP, bilateral and private funding, and early market payments are also options for funding, but they must be based on performance.
Phase 3: Performance-based payments
By phase 3, performance-based payments sourced through market mechanisms such as the carbon market and fund-based mechanisms would pay for third-party-verifiable emissions reductions and carbon- stock enhancements. Market policies must be designed with the objective of creating equitable distribution mechanisms, stabilizing prices, and developing risk-management and credit-management vehicles. Third-party verification against national reference levels should include social and environmental audits. Benefit-sharing mechanisms and monitoring processes would be developed as part of the learning-by-doing process that would characterize the phased approach.
Triggers
The use of triggers could help to streamline and facilitate a country’s progress from one phase to another and to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks. Based on social and environmental criteria rather than achievements in emissions reductions alone, triggers would strengthen the focus on and development of safeguards that guarantee the meaningful participation of key stakeholder groups; the establishment of risk management; and the promotion of social and environmental co-benefits, including biodiversity conservation and the provision of other ecosystem services.
PHASE l: PREPARATION AND READINESS
Outcomes in phase 1
Participants in the TFD dialogues emphasized the importance of the following specific outcomes during phase 1:
► National REDD-plus strategies should be built in a participatory way, should fully account for the rights and roles of indigenous peoples and local communities, and should analyse the drivers of deforestation as well as gaps in forest governance.
►- REDD-plus strategies should build on the experiences and outcomes of pilot projects through a process of learning by doing.
     Real political determination is needed to integrate REDEFplus strategies into existing government structures and government functions such as poverty-reduction strategies and other overarching cross-sectoral policies. Capacity-building measures will rely largely on collaboration and partnerships among nations, including through regional approaches. Forest-governance reform is a key focus of phase 1. Special attention should be paid to tenure arrangements, rights, risk assessment and forest-law reform and enforcement. Equitable multi-stakeholder processes and benefit-sharing mechanisms are prerequisites for successful REDD-plus implementation. ►- Technical issues to be addressed through stakeholder consultations and dialogues include:
• agreements on the scope of REDEFplus and its applicability in terms of locations and stakeholders
• agreements among land users, land beneficiaries and land owners, and on fiduciary control mechanisms
• the identification of opportunity costs, both within and outside the forest sector.
► New strategies will be needed that move beyond business-as- usual models to facilitate transformational change.
)►- Activities in phase 1 should be built into UNFCCC processes and existing, transparent financial accounting systems should be used. Property rights associated with carbon should be defined in a manner similar to existing property-rights models, ► Protocols for multi-stakeholder participation at both the international and national levels need to be designed in line with international guidelines and principles. Important issues for which protocols are required include dealing with grievances and conflicts, and arrangements and criteria for the sharing and distribution of benefits. Multi-stakeholder platforms can help build national and sub-national awareness of REDD-plus, Protocols are also needed for the creation of information databases for setting reference levels and maintaining inventories. Cross-sectoral analysis, review and research are needed to inform and create clear understanding in the following areas:
• policy and governance gaps
• environmental and social auditing
• market elements such as legal contracts, revenue flow, and carbon-market supply chains
• national reference levels
• MRV system development
• locations for pilot projects
• the roles of different actors—e g, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations and governments—in REDD- plus
• Training topics for pilot projects and stakeholder groups, such as carbon accounting, project management and natural resource management
• The varying capacities of nations to leverage negotiations on REDD-plus,
National and regional policy planning must connect landscape- scale land-use plans and forest management plans.

Safeguards in phase 1
The development of social and environmental safeguards for REDD-plus is an essential precondition for successful REDD-plus implementation and will only be achieved through the transparent and meaningful participation of stakeholders, including indigenous peoples and local communities, REDD-plus implementation should be accompanied by specific safeguards with the following characteristics:
► The United Nations Economic and Social Council’s Nine Major Groups structure—as found within the UNFF and the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD)— serves as the model for inclusive stakeholder participation for REDD-plus,
► National authorities recognize the role of local and traditional authorities, for example at the village level, and support these to participate in capacity-building,
► Self-selection is encouraged, as is the flow of information back to local communities and all participants,
► A system is developed for representation and there are basic guidelines on processes for nominating participants and spokespersons,
► Participants in REDD-plus stakeholder processes should represent the interests of broader groups. Legitimate (self) selection processes and bread representation are important but should not compromise the efficiency of the process. Models based on majority votes or con sen sus-building are possible, and an enhanced grievance mechanism is essential,
► Safeguards should protect the most vulnerable of the forest- dependent poor. Youth and women are particularly susceptible to disenfranchisement, to having their rights denied and to being overlooked in stakeholder consultations, REDD-plus must incorporate safeguards that ensure the adequate representation of women and youth.

Finance mechanisms for phase 1
Bilateral and multilateral grants are important sources of finance for phase 1 but there is a danger that current availability is insufficient. Building the capacity of forest nations to leverage negotiations on REDD- plus can help bridge the gap, but TFD-dialogue participants also suggested the following actions and possible financial sources:
► the establishment of national forest finance plans, with financial strategies and flows from national treasuries
► funding from the private sector, for example as part of corporate social responsibility initiatives
► the development of forest-carbon bonds as finance mechanisms
► the preparation of pilot projects
► public-sector and private-sector funding
► multilateral arrangements from mechanisms such as FCPF and UN-REDD
► bilateral grants
► a levy on in-country voluntary market projects to assist in paying for in-country capacity-building
voluntary carbon markets
► proposed windows within the UNFCCC.
Triggers and eligibility criteria for phase 1
Triggers could be relatively soft in phase 1 to encourage countries to participate and to progress quickly from plans to action. REDD-plus strategies should be endorsed by all stakeholders and should recognize traditional ways of managing the forest. Landscape and land-use plans, forest management plans and development policies should be harmonized at the national and sub-national levels and there should be a plan for overcoming governance and policy gaps.
PHASE 2: POLICIES AND MEASURES
Outcomes in phase 2
This phase should focus on the implementation of measures for credible and permanent carbon deliveries as part of national policy frameworks
and reforms in the forest sector. In order to make REDD-plus a viable, permanent land-use option, socioeconomic imbalances in countries must be addressed. Capacity-building will be required to strengthen the ability of governments to implement policies and measures, especially in the following areas:
► research, development and government reporting on REDEF plus methodologies
► pilot activities with conclusions for the development of IvIRV systems through the participation of stakeholders
► incentives, including tax exemptions, to encourage stakeholders to participate in REDEFplus implementation
► the building of local and national guarantor institutions
► the development of livelihood risk-management mechanisms
► the implementation of grievance mechanisms
►- paving the way for upfront investments
►- the development of institutional capacity to implement forest- governance and land-tenure reforms
►- the building of links with other sectors, such as energy, agriculture and development.
REDEFplus must move beyond project-based transactions. Meaningful implementation requires that REDEFplus has a range of project categories that will be eligible for different funding sources. Forest- related policy and legal reform must address the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation using international standards, including forest certification standards. The clarification and formalization of tenure rights, land rights and carbon rights are key requirements for successful REDE)-plus mechanisms. Concerns include whether and how REDD-plus finance mechanisms can adequately address conflicts between de jure and de facto traditional land-tenure arrangements, and how they can put the principle of FPIC into practice.
National REDEFplus finance portfolios should include private-sector and public-sector participation at the sub-national and project levels and

should provide funding for pilot projects that allow REDD-plus to develop through a process of learning by doing. Adaptive management will be encouraged by equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms.
A reliable, transparent, accountable, permanent and efficient operational infrastructure must be put in place to support the development of carbon markets as well as markets related to payments for other ecosystem services, which are developing rapidly into recognized financial markets. The development of an international forest-carbon-offset transaction log coupled with multiple international registries would playa significant role in the management and fracking of carbon-credit ownership and in assuring permanence and authenticity, and would help to overcome legal, transactional and capacity obstacles while improving regulatory capacity within the private and public sectors. The use of the International Transaction Log,® coupled with international registries, would ensure the integration of national, sub-national and project-based forest- carbon transactions (both ex-ante and ex-post registry), carbon accounting, financial accounting, leakage risk, risk mitigation, and trading. Depending on scale (eg. the area of land involved or the amount of carbon sequestered), leakage could be defined at the national level or the project level, or It could be based on performance standards. This recommendation takes into account key learning from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDIvl)and the voluntary carbon market.
Safeguards in phase 2
Environmental and social audits should be implemented by independent bodies and incorporated into the IvIRV system with periodic monitoring. To increase efficiency, third parties should be appointed from among existing organizations equipped with IvIRV capacity. Markets generally see social and environmental safeguards as acting to reduce risk.
The sustainability of long-term financial flows for REDD-plus should be considered at a portfolio level rather than instrument by instrument. From a carbon-accounting point of view, the capacity for institutional risk mitigation is important for ensuring the permanence of forest carbon. Various financial tools are available to assure the sustainability of financial flows at the institutional level, and such financial tools need to be fully explored.
National REDD-plus portfolios would be developed in phase 2, and pilot projects would allow the development of initiatives as part of a process of learning by doing. Benefits should be shared through equitable distribution mechanisms.
To address the commitment issue for investors and donors, a mechanism is needed to provide certainty on, for example, institutional permanence, carbon sequestration, the equitable distribution of revenues, the conservation of biodiversity, and adherence to the principle of FPIC. It is suggested that, where appropriate, currently existing forest-carbon accounting protocols could be used, along with measures for the equitable distribution of revenue and the conservation of biodiversity so as to create a rating system for country-level ""investability"". Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative principles could be
used to rate transparency and to create a response system for challenges, including legality licensing under forest law enforcement and governance (FLEG) initiatives.
The question of country participation is, according to many forest leaders, not so much about how to prevent countries from “opting out” than about how to guarantee that countries “stay in.” They can be encouraged to do so by providing mechanisms that allow flexibility regarding future participation. A self-regulated, multi-stakeholder approach can also help because the various stakeholder groups would hold each other accountable for a transparent agreement reached by all. A transparent, iterative and adaptive management system that demonstrably provides economic benefits can therefore provide an incentive for countries to stay in the process.
The non-legally binding instrument of the UNFF and the criteria and indicators of the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) can be used as references for environmental and social audits that ensure that:
there are safeguards to assure environmental and biodiversity integrity
the drivers of deforestation and degradation, which are well- documented, are taken into account in safeguard policies policies are in line with land tenure and management, and REDD-plus is an integral element of an agreed land-use concept at the landscape level
livelihood guarantees and organizational rights are secured a system for MRV is agreed upon by all stakeholders.
There should be a clearly defined and appropriate mechanism for the implementation of FPIC based on international standards and best practices for indigenous peoples. Indigenous groups and representatives must be allowed to participate in policy formulation.
MRV systems relate to and should include social and economic variables.
Finance mechanisms in phase 2
A portfolio of financial flows for REDD-plus finance can make use of a variety of market-based and fund-based sources, including:
depending on country capacity, the leveraging of negotiations on REDD-plus
mixed grants, loans and concession loans global facilities, such as the FCPF and the FIP domestic funding from national budgets public and private sources
bilateral and multilateral public-sector and private-sector flows pilot performance-based payments
voluntary contributions obtained from governments through market-linked or transaction-linked international levies and the auctioning of emission allowances.
In order for financial flows to be secure, finance systems must be based on national and local funding mechanisms that are integrated. For example, a country could integrate its national carbon accounting with the functions of national forest and environmental agencies in order to ensure accountability and transparency within a national legal framework that provides for the equitable distribution of revenue while enhancing biodiversity. Countries could also develop a global pipeline of ex-ante forest-carbon credits that are available for early investment by the public and private sectors.
Multilateral concessional financing sources, such as the FIP, bilateral and private funding, and early market payments, would be available.
The underwriting of financial, livelihood and political risks is important. This means that the avoidance of financial, social and environmental risks should be prepared for in accordance with common financial risk- management practices with an emphasis on the capacity of a seller to receive financing. There should be rules for performance-based payments, and equitable distribution mechanisms should be in place.
Triggers in phase 2 that would guide countries to move to phase 3 could include legal rights, independent third-party auditing of the land registry, the endorsement of benefit-distribution mechanisms by the stakeholder platforms, and/or the capacity to implement and audit REDD-plus projects at the national level. Carbon registry software should be linked to the International Emissions Trading Organization and the International Transaction Log, Proxy indicators could include emissions reductions or enhanced removals as performance-based rewards, or progress in governance reform, FPIC should be based on international standards and best practices,
PHASE 3: PERFORMANCE-BASED PAYMENTS
Outcomes in phase 3
By phase 3, national and local REDD-plus projects should be achieving effective emissions reductions and carbon-stock enhancements through carbon markets and fund-based mechanisms. Results should be third- party-verified and effective MRV systems should be in place—with governments reporting according to stringent standards and against national reference levels. Financial, social and environmental risks should all be underwritten; social and environmental safeguards should therefore not be a burden but, rather, should contribute to the attractiveness of REDD-plus investments. Equitable benefit-distribution mechanisms should also be verified. The monitoring processes should be developed as part of a learning process.
Safeguards in phase 3
In the third phase, financial, social and environmental audits should be implemented as part of MRV or parallel to it. The spirit of FPIC should be reflected in safeguards.
The participation of indigenous peoples, women and other marginalized groups, as well as the private sector, in REDD-plus is essential. Measures to improve multi-stakeholder participation, including local and traditional authorities and the United Nations Economic and Social Council’s Nine Major Groups structure, should therefore be considered.
Financial accounting guidance for recognizing forest-carbon assets can be derived from the Financial Accounting Standards Beard and the International Accounting Standards Beard, Third-party verification should take place against national reference levels.
Finance mechanisms in phase 3
Market-based mechanisms, such as carbon markets, as well as fund- based mechanisms, should deliver performance-based payments for third- party-veri fia ble emissions reductions and carbon-stock enhancement, REDD-plus finance can be integrated into both compliance and non- compliance funds.
Building on the learning achieved through existing benefit-sharing mechanisms, market policies must be designed in such a way as to create equitable distribution mechanisms.
Policies should focus on stabilizing prices and on the development of risk-management and credit-management vehicles.
Payments should be managed according to the performance of carbon storage at a large scale. Viability should be secured through clear standards, transparency and sufficiently low transaction costs.
Secure funds can be derived from voluntary and regulated carbon markets and government funds.
Double-counting should be avoided by ensuring the transparency of registries and the integration of transaction logs, A public-sector and/or private-sector financial seivices provider should assess the eligibility of forest-carbon assets through the underwriting of risk.



Financial Architecture
A phased approach to the implementation of REDD-plus and the development of financial frameworks for REDD-plus has several advantages, including:
the room it creates for an extensive preparation-and-readiness phase, thus enabling the strengthening of governance arrangements and capa city-building allowing the debate on financing to move beyond ""fund versus market,""
COMMITMENTS, GOVERNANCE REFORM AND MIXED FUNDING
Financial arrangements for REDE>-plus activities will have to fulfil different requirements in different countries and the volume of finance will have to increase over time. Stable, reliable and long-term financial flows require commitments from both developed and developing countries and strong coordination between public-sector and private- sector donors and investors.
Developed countries must be willing to guarantee support and long-term finance arrangements that depart from business-as-usual models for north-south financial transfers. Developing countries need to commit to policy and institutional changes that focus on the transformation of land- use dynamics, forest governance, and the flow of resources to indigenous peoples and local communities. Since a voluntary fund cannot be used by participating developed countries for compliance, there is a need for market-based approaches.
It is unlikely that financial support will be available for REDE>-plus in contexts where basic good governance is lacking, even though the need for REDD-plus is often most urgent in such places. This has been coined the ""governance paradox"" and deserves greater attention in debates on REDE)-plus financing. Oneway to address the paradox is to make upfront official development assistance (ODA)-style funds available in phase 1 that can be used to improve governance, REDD-plus finance must pay
attention to broader mitigation blueprints and seek greater integration with other sectors, rather than being a stand-alone effort.
Possibilities for linking a REDD-plus finance framework with payments for other ecosystem services such as biodiversity should be explored. ITTO’s efforts in this regard through its “REDD and Enhancing Environmental Services in Tropical Forests” (REDDES) thematic program can serve as an example. A broadening of payments would encourage essential intersectoral cooperation; by providing additional income it would also help offset the opportunity costs needed, for example, to prevent the conversion of forests and forest land to high-yield cash-crop farming.
Any REDD finance mechanism—market-based or fund-based—needs to properly address the concepts of carbon stock and flow, uncertainty, and discount rates. Clarity on these concepts is important because they will underpin the decision-making of any investor providing funds for REDD- plus, whether a donor, a government institution or a market actor. Investments in REDD-readiness can help to make countries competitive within a future REDD-finance architecture, and an effective preparation- and-readiness phase can ensure the full and informed acceptance of REDD-plus by local communities. Experiences with voluntary carbon markets and afforestation and reforestation through the CDM provide valuable lessons for the design of REDD-plus finance mechanisms. REDD- plus finance frameworks must be iterative, transparent and adaptive.
FUND-BASED AND MARKET-BASED FUNDING OPTIONS UNDER A PHASED APPROACH
A phased approach would allow countries to develop funding options that are tailored to their specific requirements and would also move the debate beyond “markets versus funds”. Countries should accommodate portfolios that make optimal and coordinated use of markets, funds and other sources of finance. A broad coalition of public-sector and private- sector institutions would be needed to provide the necessary upfront investments for phases 1 and 2, along with bilateral and multilateral loans and grants. REDD-plus funding must be additional to regular ODA.
Interim funding for phases 1 and 2 can be obtained through bilateral funds or arrangements such as the FCPF and UN-REDD, and the FIP can assist with capacity-building as well as make initial investments. Funding requirements will increase, and the predictability and continuity of funding will also be crucial. Over time, additional sources of funding could include grants, loans and guaranteed finance from multilateral banks and carbon markets. Options for long-term finance include a voluntary, ODA-type fund and direct market mechanisms for REDD-plus credits. A hybrid mechanism might also be created that generates finance through auction processes or by establishing a dual market in which REDD-plus credits are linked but are not fully fungible with existing certified emission reductions. While a combination of mechanisms might be essential for addressing the specific and varying socioeconomic needs of different countries, it is also essential that effective and transparent governance arrangements are in place.
Carbon markets could be implemented within a short time frame and would have far greater potential in terms of volume than ODA-type funding. They also encourage risk management at local levels that directly addresses implementation problems on the ground and therefore reduces the need to deal with these issues at the national level. The idea of carbon markets is contentious, however, because of sensitivities about the governance and institutional reforms that would need to take place, such as those that may be construed as impinging on national sovereignty or that address property rights. Most participants in the TFD dialogues were convinced that it is very unlikely that funding would be made available in contexts lacking basic governance arrangements.
Distribution mechanisms are most relevant in phase 2: they must ensure that benefits reach all stakeholders and they must be sensitive to future generations. It is important that benefits are not diminished disproportionately by intermediaries on their way to beneficiaries at ground level.
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification, Financial Assurance
The success of REDD-plus implémentation will stand or fall on the extent to which it achieves third-party-verifiable C02 emissions reductions. Equally important, however, are financial efficiency and the fulfilment of fundamental social and environmental safeguards.
Consensus was reached in the TFD dialogues on the importance of safeguard policies, which should be designed within a phased- approach framework. In other words, the preparation-and-readiness, policies-and-measures, and implementation phases should all be equipped with safeguard instruments that consider transparency, ownership, legality, governance and FPIC. In addition, safeguards must guarantee that stakeholder groups, notably commonly marginalized groups such as indigenous peoples, small forest owners and enterprises, and community groups, have the capacity to organize and represent themselves in decision-making processes. Key stakeholder groups should be identified in the preparation-and-readiness phase and a participation mechanism should be designed to facilitate the flow of information among these groups over the course of the three phases. FPIC should be implemented in each phase, although the focus would change between phases.
In addition to the assessment of changes in carbon stocks, the performance of REDD-plus activities should be measured against social, environmental and financial indicators at the local, national and global levels. Socially, environmentally and financially sound processes, based on adaptive management and learning, and with full and effective community participation, will produce secure and tradable carbon assets that are appropriate to the market-oriented system that would characterize phase 3. In phase 1, the emphasis would be on reducing risks and setting the parameters for REDD-plus activities that will deliver reductions in later phases, ensuring the effectiveness of the mechanism through strong stakeholder involvement. It is also important to reduce risks to livelihoods: this will require attention to governance reforms; land, tenure and carbon rights; and the rights and needs of indigenous peoples and other local communities. In phase 2, the delivery of REDD- plus finance can be measured against performance-based proxies such as overall rates of deforestation, the Implementation of policies, and the strengthening, in practice, of the rights of local communities. Performance in phase 3 must be underpinned by the independent third- party verification of C02 emissions reductions according to local circumstances in Individual countries.
There is common ground among forest stakeholders on the need to adhere to the principle of FPIC in Implementing REDD-plus strategies; it should be applied in each phase. Mechanisms for addressing grievances and resolving conflicts should be incorporated as important safeguards. Participants in the TFD dialogues noted that the intent of FPIC is closely linked to stakeholder participation and consultation as well as the delivery of co-benefits, such as sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity conservation, and the equitable sharing and distribution of forest-carbon- related income. FPIC is a right for indigenous peoples, but it is also a consultative process and a requirement that applies to other stakeholders, such as local communities and forest owners.
Social, environmental and financial audits must be equal in status to other aspects of REDEFplus monitoring. Safeguards can best be maintained through third-party monitoring with limited government control and verification, or through the full ceding of social and environmental audits to a third party. Improved cross-sectoral cooperation and coordination at the national and sub-national levels would help improve the capacity to maintain safeguards. Audits should build on existing methodologies and encourage engagement with the private sector. While safeguards are important, REDEFplus arrangements should not be overloaded with requirements that threaten innovation in the market or land-ownership reform processes. Equally, given that it is basically an emissions-driven mechanism, REDEFplus should not be expected to perform miracles in advancing social and environmental agendas.

Social auditing must include specific arrangements for focusing on gender issues and for the inclusion of youth. Indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent people must be engaged in the design and implementation ofall the activities of REDD-plus mechanisms. Benefits cannot be prescribed but must flow from processes that engage and consult local groups from the earliest stages of decision-making processes. Adequate distribution mechanisms should be assured and benefit arrangements should be clarified. The monitoring and avoidance of negative impacts on forest-dependent poor is the absolute minimum reference level.
Environmental auditing should report on the delivery of biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of other ecosystem functions, such as the protection of watersheds and soils and the continued provision of timber and non-timber forest products. The conservation of high-biodiversity areas needs to be prioritized, including in early action on forest landscape restoration. As for social and financial audits, independent third-party verification is preferred.

Institutional Arrangements
The implementation of REDD-plus requires forest-governance reforms through inclusive processes that build on existing forest-governance systems. REDE>-plus implementation will draw on lessons from existing carbon-accounting mechanisms, such as those deployed in the voluntary carbon markets.
GOVERNANCE REFORM AND INCLUSIVE PROCESSES
The strengthening of governance arrangements and institutions needs to incorporate learning through piloting, adaptive management and knowledge transfer. The focus should be on making progress on issues such as carbon rights, tenure rights and distribution mechanisms.
A REDD-plus oversight body with technical, financial and administrative responsibilities, including on forest governance and REDE>-plus protocols, should be set up under the COP to ensure viable REDE>-plus finance in the long run. Representation by countries could be on the basis of United Nations regions. The REDD-plus oversight body must have the authority to evaluate the eligibility of countries to move from one phase of REDE>-plus to the next. The COP could set the priorities, such as caps on the proportion of C02 emissions that Annex I countries may offset. A project-by-project approach could be taken in phases 1 and 2, with grants and early action generated by the private sector. REDE>-plus governance structures at both the national and international levels must include independent cross-cutting mechanisms for addressing grievances and resolving conflicts. Corruption cannot be overlooked, but nor can REDD-plus be expected to eliminate it on its own.
REDD-plus must be underpinned by transparent, inclusive and accountable forest management based on local processes. This will require strong partnerships founded on respect for the rights and active participation of indigenous peoples and local communities, consistent with international obligations and standards such as UNDRIP and locally defined measures and legal systems. A key concern is the clarification and strengthening of tenure, property and carbon rights. Where possible, the engagement of stakeholders should build on the many national-level experiences of stakeholder involvement in FLEG processes. Multi- stakeholder platforms in the REDD-plus planning process would not only contribute to equitable participation and representation, they would also be more effective and generate more efficient interventions. Multi- stakeholder platforms promote better understanding of the role of each stakeholder group and help improve communication between groups and can therefore help to avoid or diminish potential conflicts.

In order to minimize transaction costs, existing forest-based instruments such as voluntary partnership agreements, UN-REDD, FIP, FCPF and FLEG should be used as much as possible in the hope of avoiding the need fora new global mechanism. Efforts should be made to strengthen coordination and collaboration between such instruments. National REDD-plus coordination bodies must work across the public and private sectors and have a multi-stakeholder membership. An important issue is the potential for channelling cross-sectoral cooperation through REDD- plus finance, which therefore should be part of the broader climate- change mitigation blueprint rather than a stand-alone effort. Integrating payments for broader ecosystem services into the REDD-plus finance framework, such as is being done by ITTO through its REDDES thematic program, can help to increase cooperation between sectors and make implementing REDD cheaper.
LESSONS FROM STANDARD TAX CODE AND ACCOUNTING
Participants in the TFD dialogues pointed to existing mechanisms that can provide lessons for designing REDD-plus finance mechanisms: these include the voluntary carbon market, afforestation and reforestation projects under the CDIvl, and other functional financial systems for payments for ecosystem services. Financing REDD-plus will be a learning process on its own; thus, the management system employed within the REDD-plus finance framework will need to be iterative, transparent and adaptive. The TFD dialogues generated suggestions for financing tools as potential safeguard instruments, including accounting principles accredited by current financial accounting standards bodies, a forest-carbon-credit insurance mechanism, and an auditing system for REDD credits,
REDD-plus mechanisms need to build on experiences gained in the existing voluntary carbon market, particularly with regards to carbon- market accounting and credible standards and certification. At the national level, REDD-plus provisions should make use of existing government regulations and structures and capitalize on existing monitoring and independent third-party-verification mechanisms, such as forest certification systems. Tax-code and financial accounting standards for carbon transactions and investments in the public and private sectors should be established, and should be compliant with existing practices and institutions. Where existing practices and institutions are inadequate, new mechanisms will need to be created. At the international level, the International Transaction Log should be used to help verify transactions.
Future Role of TFD
Forest nations in the tropics are showing an interest in participating in future REDD-plus mechanisms, but the monetary and technical resources available for the planning and implementation of readiness processes are still limited. Although approaches to REDD-plus will need to be country-specific and will differ, for example, in their sources of funding, policymakers and decision-makers in different countries will face very similar problems in the development of national REDEFplus strategies. There is a risk that the vital inputs of stakeholders on key issues around REDD-plus, and opportunities to share experiences and lessons learned from pilot projects and national processes, will be lost.
TFD can playa key role by creating a feedback loop between the international and local levels that will assist in adapting approaches to country-specific situations and changing circumstances, guided by longterm rules, TFD’s field dialogues aim to bridge the gaps between enthusiasm and know-how and to make sure that the voices of diverging stakeholders are better heard. In October 2009 TFD started its REDD- readiness field dialogues, a third stream of dialogues under the ""Forests and Climate"" theme, with the aims of:
►  catalyzing stakeholder engagement processes, raising awareness, and promoting the exploration of REDEF readiness challenges
►  learning from national and local experiences on the preparation-and-readiness phase of REDD-plus
► establishing a feedback loop between international and local REDEF plus-related processes
CONCLUDING COMMENT
Participants in TFD’s initiative on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation recognized that REDD-plus will only achieve lasting results if it can be adapted to the individual circumstances of countries and if countries have the political will to adapt policies and methods to meet the needs of REDEFplus implementation. The nature of the finance mechanisms that underpin REDE>-plus is critical for determining whether and how these pre-conditions for success are met.

Foreword
Climate change is one of the most pressing threats to development today. Addressing climate change requires that countries transform their economies and grow in a different way — climate and development planning must be integrated so that policies and actions across multiple sectors and scales lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduce vulnerability to climate shocks and deliver poverty reduction gains.
The good news is that countries have new and expanded opportunities to finance climate change actions — billions from the public and private sectors will be channeled toward climate activities. In order for countries to take advantage of these opportunities, however, the right institutional and financial mechanisms must be in place so that resources are directed efficiently toward national climate and development priorities.
An important tool for countries to manage climate finance is a National Climate Fund NCFs are nation- ally-driven and nationally-owned funds that help countries to collect climate finance from a variety of sources, coordinate them, blend them together and aoiount for them. In this way, countries are in the driving seat and can make informed choices fo r how direct resources toward activities that deliver results on the ground
This guidebook is part of a series of practical guida nee documents and toolkits to support national and sub-national governments to achieve low-emission, climate-resilient development It provides information based on UNDP's decades of experience in delivering climate change programming in order to help countries design and establish an NCF that is tailored to their priorities and builds on existing governance, policy and fiscal framework and systerrs.
It is my hope that this guidebook will contribute to the ongoing efforts of countries to manage climate change finance and that it will support countries to be more equipped to achieve transformational change whereby positive develop ment and poverty reduction are achieved and sustained over time.

Overview
Overview
By pledging $30 billion in climate change finance by 2012 and up to $100 billion annually by 2020, governments have ushered in a new era of funding for climate change. Only ten years ago, climate finance was managed by a small number of large funds associated with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. Today, there has been an explosion of public, private, bilateral and multilateral sources that offer countries new opportunities to address their climate and development needs.
While this new landscape of climate change funds provides increased resources, it also brings increased complexity. Requirements, processes and reporting can differ among the funds and countries are faced with the challenge of identifying which funds are appropriate for them, how to collect resources, how to blend them together, how to coordinate the actions funded by them and how to develop the methods to monitor and evaluate the results. Given the diversity of funds, it is critical that countries can build on existing institutions and programmes to manage resources at the national level to support country- driven objectives.
One tool that can help countries respond to these challenges is a National Climate Fund (NCF). An NCF is a mechanism that supports countries to manage their engagement with climate finance by facilitating the collection, blending, coordination of, and accounting for climate finance. NCFs provide a country- driven system that can support climate change goal setting and strategic programming, oversee climate change project approval, measure project implementation and performance, offer policy assurance and financial control of climate change funds and assist with partnership management. NCFs help countries to blend various resources together at the national level, providing a mechanism for shifting power away from traditional top-down fund management to country-level management. A country's climate change objectives are managed and supported from the inside out, not the other way around.
Designing an NCF requires carefully considering its objectives and then crafting a structure that supports the achievement of these objectives. Many NCFs deliver a common set of services, however the exact components and structures to deliver the services vary greatly according to national circumstances and priorities. In other words, the way in which the fund's components are designed shapes how the NCF delivers its support. For example, an NCF capitalized by international and national public finance will collect and blend resources differently that an NCF that relies only on private finance. Tailored fiscal tools and mechanisms will be required to access and channel public and private sources effectively. Further, depending on its capitalization modalities, an NCF may aim to strengthen capacities of national stake holders, including for direct access to climate finance.

Overview
A key lesson learned from UNDP's experience in administering over 750 funds around the world, and in providing trustee and administrative agent services for over $5 billion in multi-donor trust funds, is that a National Climate Fund must be carefully designed to align with national objectives and capacities on climate change. To accomplish this, the design and administration of an NCF can demand extensive time, effort and resources. While this guidebook does not focus on if a country should establish an NCF, it does help countries deepen their understanding of the design choices that are critical to successful NCFs. In the pages that follow, countries can identify the scope and scale of an NCF that matches their needs and priorities and decide if an NCF is right for them.
It is UNDP's hope that this guidebook will help countries to make the most out of the expanding climate change finance landscape. Well-designed NCFs can better equip countries to blend domestic and international, public and private, and concessional loan and grant climate finance at the national level. In this way, NCFs can help countries achieve results and more efficiently and effectively support the transition toward low-emission and climate-resilient development.
Purpose of Guidebook
The purpose of this guidebook is to assist countries in designing a National Climate Fund. It leverages UNDP's experience with funds at the global, regional, national and sub-national levels and shares lessons learned about designing and administering NCFs. It also aims to provide a simple, robust and transparent method for meaningful stakeholder engagement throughout the design process.

Chapter 1: Overview of National Climate Funds
Overview of National Climate Funds
1.1 | Climate Finance Landscape
Climate change is regarded as a key environment and development challenge for the 21st century. Affecting every continent, climate change impacts threaten to undo progress made toward poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Governments agree that business- as-usual development will not suffice — countries need a new way forward that helps their economies grow in a manner that acknowledges the pressing reality of climate change. Countries must transition toward a new paradigm that supports low-emission, climate-resilient development, shifts production and consumption processes to emit fewer greenhouse gases and promotes sustainable development.
Ushering in a new development paradigm requires a dramatic increase in climate change finance. Recognizing this, governments gathered at the UNFCCC Climate Change Conference in Cancun and pledged $30 billion in ""fast start"" funding — climate funds pledged between 2010 and 2012 — and up to $100 billion annually by 2020. These pledges have been matched by an explosion of public and private funds outside of the UNFCCC process, offering countries new resources to undertake climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. UNDP estimates that, taken together, there are already more than 50 international public funds, 45 carbon markets and 6,000 private equity funds providing climate change finance.1 Each of these public, private, bilateral and multilateral sources offers new opportunities for countries to address their climate and development needs.
The increase in climate change funding opportunities makes it important for countries to consider how to attract and leverage different types of climate change investment, including that from private sources. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that about 40% of the global additional investment needed in climate change finance in 2020 will come from private households, 40% from businesses and the remaining 20% from government.2 With private sector funds outnumbering government funds by an enormous margin, a key challenge for countries will be to use scarce public funds to attract private investment. Public funds — such as those under the UNFCCC — must be leveraged in strategic ways to attract new resources from the private sector.
The dramatic increase in opportunities to access climate finance is matched by equally increasing complexity. The requirements, processes and reporting associated with the many funds can be confusing and overwhelming. Countries are faced with the challenge of how to identify which funds are appropriate for them, how to coordinate the actions funded by them,and how to develop the methods to monitor and evaluate the results.2 Further, countries must also figure out ways to blend funds together so that multiple sources can support climate change initiatives. This will be necessary to finance a complete transformation toward low-emission and climate-resilient development.








































Chapter 1: Overview of National Climate Funds
1.2 Key Goals of a National Climate Fund
One tool that countries can use to meet this challenge is a National Climate Fund (NCF). NCFs are a mechanism that supports countries to direct finance toward climate change projects and programmes. The key goals of an NCF are the collection, blending, and coordination, as well as strengthening national ownership, of climate finance (Figure 2). Each of these goals can be tailored to support country-driven climate change priorities based on national circumstances and realities. NCFs can also serve as a gateway for enhanced capacity building and knowledge sharing among stakeholders.
The NCF's four goals provide the foundation for its programmatic and operational components. First, by collecting and distributing funds to climate change activities that promote national priorities, an NCF
provides a unified engagement point where the government, donors, development partners, civil society and other stakeholders can engage on and make decisions about climate change issues.
Moreover, while traditional mechanisms under the UNFCCC are limited to collecting donor funds or resources under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an NCF can attract a more diverse variety of sources of climate financing. Public, private, multilateral and bilateral funds, as well as innovative sources, can be collected by an NCF for coordinated and streamlined results.
Second, an NCF facilitates the blending of public, private, multilateral and bilateral sources of climate finance. It is rare that one or two funds would be able to cover the costs necessary to transition and entire economy toward low-emission, climate-resilient development. Rather, countries must blend together multiple sources — public, private, multilateral, bilateral — in a coordinated and streamlined way that is strategic and can further catalyze more resources to support action on climate change.
NCFs can be designed to complement and blend sources from the emerging global public climate change financial system. The Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund and the emerging Green Climate Fund will each collect resources and direct them toward climate projects at the regional, national and subnational level. National Climate Funds are not meant to duplicate these financial flows, collect funds from them or increase the burden on countries and implementing entities. Rather, NCFs provide a mechanism that can blend these resources with others resources at the project level. NCFs can provide the means for leveraging public funds to attract private funds and provide national-level coordination among and alongside the global climate finance system.
Third, NCFs can coordinate country-wide climate change activities. The NCF mechanism responds to the need to provide flexible, coordinated and predictable funding to support the achievement of national priorities on climate change and development. In their structure and operations, NCFs are consistent with several principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, including national ownership and alignment with national priorities; harmonization and coordination; effective and inclusive partnerships; and achieving development results and accounting for them.









































1.3 I Common Functions of a National Climate Fund
Once a country decides to establish an NCF, stakeholders must identify the specific and necessary functions of the NCF. Functions should build upon existing mechanisms and systems that support action on climate change. They can include goal setting, strategic programming, capitalization, partnership management, project approval, policy assurance, financial control and performance measurement. Each should be considered carefully. The functions of an NCF influence its components and services. An NCF with ill-designed functions runs the risk of not only failing to reach its goals, but of undermining progress toward low-emission, climate-resilient development.
In UNDP's experience, there are a number of core functions that are common to any funding mechanism, including NCFs. First, an NCF should enhance or provide a system that supports goal setting and the development of programmatic strategies on climate change. By setting in place a process that aligns and supports existing general goals and strategic programmes, the NCF can provide a coordinated supporting structure to a country's national climate and development priorities. Further, by facilitating regular discussions and stakeholder engagement on national climate issues, an NCF can serve as a central body for discussion and decision-making about how the NCF will support national action.
An NCF should provide for fundraising toward climate priorities. Indeed, the capitalization of the NCF — its ability to collect and raise funds — is one of the core functions that make an NCF a useful tool for implementing low-emission, climate-resilient development. As demonstrated in Chapter 2, capitalization can take a variety of forms and can utilize public, private, multilateral, bilateral and innovative sources of finance.
An NCF can provide a mechanism for managing partnerships by clearly defining and coordinating the roles of various climate change stakeholders. The NCF can complement and support the management of relationships with other financing mechanisms, such as those under the UNFCCC or with other multilateral, bilateral, public and private sources. It can also ensure the clear management of the responsibilities of stakeholders at all levels and across climate change initiatives.
NCFs can provide a coordinated project approval and implementation structure for climate change programming. Uniform project cycle guidelines that clearly outline the technical and eligibility requirements support streamlined operations. Well-conceived guidelines can facilitate the transparent approval process of NCF climate change initiatives.
Moreover, an NCF can supply systems to ensure that quality standards are met throughout its operations. NCFs offer policy assurance through social and environmental safeguards, financial controls that ensure fiscal monitoring and reporting and performance measurement that outlines specific performance criteria and then evaluates projects and programmes to ensure that the NCF delivers effectively and efficiently.
The NCF can become an important source of knowledge and information management that consolidates and disseminates lessons from climate change projects and programmes. The exchange of such information can build capacity, help projects implement good practices and spur innovative solutions to implement country-driven priorities on climate change.

Chapter 2: Designing a National Climate Fund

2.1 | Common Components and Structural 1 Overview of a National Climate Fund
Given the diversity of design options, there are a number of key decisions that must be made in order to ensure that an appropriate and effective NCF structure is established that maximizes the delivery of climate finance to support national priorities. Important decisions on each component of the fund must be considered in order for an NCF to achieve the core goals and functions described in Chapter 1. Based on UNDP's experience in the administration of over 750 trust funds and more than 40 multi-donor trust funds, six common components have been identified that provide the basic skeleton for any NCF: objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary management, implementation arrangements and monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV).
Chapter 2 of this guidebook focuses on a step-by-step decision-making process for the design of each component. A description of each component is accompanied by a series of targeted questions that facilitate decision-making for that element. The end of Chapter 2 brings all of these decisions together into a term sheet that facilitates stakeholder engagement and consolidates stakeholder inputs on each component.
NCFs are not ""one-size-fits-all,"" but many funds arrange the components into a common structure to support the delivery of NCF services. The structure includes funding sources, governing bodies, a trustee and implementers. Funding sources provide funds to the NCF while the governing bodies make decisions about the operations of the fund. The trustee manages the transfers of funds to and from the NCF's bank account. Implementers receive funds and ensure activities are undertaken. Each of these agents supports the delivery of actions to achieve the strategic priorities of the NCF.
UNDP has developed a structural overview (Figure 3) that demonstrates how these components can be arranged and the various design questions that must be answered. Resources, coordination, support and MRV flow between sources, governing bodies, the trustee, implementers and recipients. Throughout each component, stakeholders should consider how the NCF will deliver its services and what structural components and design decisions are necessary to support the achievement of the NCF's priorities.

A set of governing bodies is usually at the centre of an NCF. Often, a steering committee or other group makes decisions on the disbursal of funds and oversees the high-level activities of the fund, including policy and operational guidelines, strategic direction and reporting. This group is often made up of multiple ministries, such as environment, planning and finance, and representatives from civil society, the United Nations, development banks, private sector or other partners. The chair person of the steering committee can be a government representative or other participant. The steering committee is usually supported by two other governing bodies, a technical group that provides substantive reviews of project proposals and a secretariat that manages day-to-day operations of the NCF.
In a majority of funds, resources flow from the sources to the trustee, which holds them on behalf of the NCF. When the governing bodies make decisions about how the funds should be allocated, the steering committee will direct the trustee to distribute the funds to the implementing entities. The implementers conduct the projects and the recipients receive the benefits. The implementers then report on their activities to the governing bodies. In the case of loans, the loans will be repaid back to the trustee.
The NCF structure can be tailored to align with its designated functions and national priorities. Depending on the objectives of an NCF, specialized systems can be put in place to manage financial flows. For example, if a fund capitalizes national banks to provide low-cost loans for projects such as renewable energy, it may assign the government as the source of funds and the national banks the trustee. MRV would be conducted by the banks according to their lending criteria. In the case of an NCF using innovative financing mechanisms, such as taxes on bunker fuels, to support activities, the infrastructure must be set up in order to accommodate the collection and distribution of these funds. This kind of flexibility helps each entity associated with the NCF to fulfill the role that best supports the objectives of the fund.
The relationship between the NCF's various bodies must be carefully defined through the design process so that each decision is implemented efficiently and promotes national climate and development objectives. The flows of funds, support and coordination of an NCF should align with its objectives so that the fund can operate smoothly.
Relationships with the private sector and civil society should also be considered and clarified. In some NCFs, the private sector and/or civil society play important roles in the fund's structure, including serving as a donor, an implementer or a representative on a governing body. In cases where the private sector or a civil society group has met the necessary fiduciary standards, they can also serve as the trustee.

















































































Importantly, NCFs must be firmly rooted in national realities. National priorities and circumstances provide an important context for NCF delivery and can lead to opportunities and challenges as an NCF becomes operational. To provide stability, NCFs should take this into account by aligning with national climate change strategies, institutions, frameworks and stakeholders; however, NCFs must also have the flexibility to adjust overtime.
Maintaining both stability and flexibility is imperative to stakeholder engagement. Throughout the design phase of an NCF, stakeholder consultations are critical to ensure that the NCF is robust and effective. Including various government, multilateral, bilateral, private and civil society actors in the development and establishment of the NCF helps to more clearly identify needs and requirements and to accommodate best practices.


















Programmatic and Management Objectives

As a first step in setting up an NCF, a country must identify its strategic goals on climate change and how the NCF will help it to achieve these goals. The NCF may serve the country by driving resources to national climate activities, such as mitigation, adaptation, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), capacity building, technology building or other priorities. An NCF’s objectives may also include attracting private sector investment, or formalizing a system to collect resources from “polluter pays” policies that collect revenue from industry.
An NCF’s objectives provide the foundation for its operations and outcomes. When setting objectives, a country should take into account its national climate and development strategies, as well as other analyses and plans, such as the National Communications, National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Nationally-Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), to identify the priorities of a National Climate Fund. These analyses can bring together current thinking on climate change, as well as focus the NCF on priority issues and sectors where activities can be undertaken in a cost-effective way.
It is critical that objectives take into account the technical and political considerations that may support or hamper the NCF’s progress over time. Thematic priorities, such as increasing renewable energy, must be supported by analyses of the feasibility of increasing investment in that sector. Likewise, to achieve other priorities of the NCF, such as capacity building for direct access to climate funds under the UNFCCC, these aims must be acknowledged, and appropriate and supportive systems be put in place.
Carefully defined objectives must be supported by appropriate functions of the NCF. If an NCF focuses on providing a type of “clearing house” for climate change initiatives, it may not be necessary to develop a complicated financial mechanism. Likewise, if an NCF is to provide low-cost loans to a specific sector, it would not be necessary for the functions of the fund to include extensive coordination systems. A country can select the objectives that match its priorities but must ensure that the objectives are fully supported by the NCF's functions.

ALIGNING OBJECTIVES WITH OTHER PRIORITIES AND FUNDING WINDOWS

These programmatic considerations should be linked closely with fund management considerations and, importantly, how the NCF will relate to other international and domestic climate funds. Some countries may have multiple NCFs that target specific issues — for example, one to provide funding for REDD activities and another for adaptation. Others NCFs may be linked to more comprehensive, national strategies. In Ethiopia, the Carbon-Neutral, Climate-Resilient Economy mission statement sets out how Ethiopia is responding to climate change and how it can transition toward low-carbon growth. The government is considering setting up a national fund to support these activities. The NCF could be a funding arm and all activities under the NCF would link to Ethiopia's mission statement. In this model, the national strategy becomes the roadmap for the NCF.
The scope of the NCF must fully support its programmatic mission. If a country has already acquired funds from a specific source, or funds have been earmarked for a specific activity, then it will be important to ensure that the structure of the NCF can channel this funding appropriately. Similarly, if a country's goals are to optimize its relationships with stakeholders (e.g., the private sector) or funding programmes (e.g., the Clean Development Mechanism) it may be necessary to codify this in the objectives.

FUND TIMELINE
Designing an NCF's objectives must also consider timelines. If a national strategy or other funding mechanism is time-bound, this may affect the timeframe of the NCF. This will be especially important as countries consider their options under the UNFCCC process. For example, if an NCF is designed to attract fast start funding, it is important to align the NCF with the 2012 deadline. Likewise, the longer-term pledges of up to $100 billion per year by 2020 include a variety of sources, including private finance, and an NCF may wish to accommodate these circumstances accordingly. Other NCFs may wish to align themselves with the specific timeframe of a national strategy.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR DEFINING THE OBJECTIVES:
1. What are the national priorities on climate change? Are there short, medium or long-term strategies that the NCF should support (including national strategies, NAMAs, etc.)?
2. Will the fund focus on thematic priorities (e.g., renewable energy) or support broader objectives?
3. How will the objectives of the fund relate to the objectives of other international and domestic funds?
4. What timeframe is most appropriate? Should the NCF be time-bound?
5. What are the expected financial flows to the fund? Have funds already been pledged? Have these funds been earmarked toward a specific activity that should be acknowledged?
6. Are there stakeholders that must be acknowledged in the objectives? (e.g., those associated with a specific industry)
7. Should the objectives acknowledge a relationship with an entity or programme?
(e.g., Clean Development Mechanism)

Building on the fund’s objectives, a country should consider the types of resources that would best capitalize the fund. Indeed, deciding where the funds will come from is one of the most important choices that will shape the NCF. Many sources of finance — including international, national, public and private — can be delivered through an NCF, but they must build on existing frameworks and be supported by appropriate structures to access and channel funding efficiently.
LINKING OBJECTIVES AND CAPITALIZATION
Fund capitalization must be realistic, grounded in the objectives and functions of the NCF. Funds with ambitious objectives must have clear expectations of how the fund will be capitalized and the objectives supported. Designers of NCFs should exercise caution in this regard: expectations of co-financing and leveraging must be based on national circumstances. Likewise, funds with smaller, targeted objectives should not aim to access billions when it is not appropriate for the scope of the NCF.
Generally, if a fund has a broad set of objectives, it usually blends together a broader array of sources than more targeted NCFs. An NCF with wide objectives — for example, supporting all of the activities under a low-emission, climate-resilient development strategy — may aim to collect funds from international and national sources so that a wide variety of activities can be covered. A fund with a more targeted mission will often only focus on a single source, such as those from one bilateral partner.





































INNOVATIVE FINANCING MECHANISMS
A country may also want to consider the use of innovative financing mechanisms to provide capital for an NCF. In this case, an NCF is designed to collect resources from non-traditional sources of finance such as levies on oil or coal production, fees from polluting companies or proceeds from carbon markets. Revenues from these sources are collected by an NCF and then directed toward the programmes and projects that fulfill the goals of the NCF. For example, the Brazil National Fund on Climate Change collects funds from revenue from the oil production industry and channels them toward climate change mitigation and adaptation activities.
Innovative mechanisms require that complementary structures be put in place within the NCF to ensure the efficient collection and delivery of funds. NCFs should have the ability to manage and account for funds coming from these non-traditional sources.

CONSIDERING CONTEXT
With both traditional and innovative sources, it is critical to consider national circumstances in order to optimize capitalization. Laws or policies may be required to access and collect certain types of funding. A tax on an industry, for example, may need to be mandated by a national law that clarifies the rates of taxation.
Understanding and acknowledging national circumstances is especially important when considering the involvement of the private sector. By aligning with existing private sector regulations and incentive structures, for example, the NCF can stimulate and attract private investment by driving public finance toward commercially attractive projects. This helps the NCF to contribute toward sound investment and policy decisions that direct private finance toward activities that address national climate and development priorities.
A country should also consider any available resources that could already feed directly into the NCF or any existing partnerships with donors. A country may wish for the NCF to absorb these resources or partnerships, or to align with them so that activities will be undertaken in a coordinated manner. If the NCF does absorb them, it is important to note whether they are ""earmarked"" toward specific activities — such as capacity building — that will affect the operations of the fund.





The capitalization of the fund has implications for the size, governance and implementation of the fund. For example, if the private sector provides resources to the fund, then it may be necessary to include private sector representatives in the governance system. Furthermore, a number of legal contracts or systems will need to be established in order to collect resources from specific sources. For innovative funds, enacting laws, policies or partnership agreements may also be necessary for the efficient capitaliza- tion of an NCF.
Countries should also consider how additional resources will be raised throughout the life of the fund. Some NCFs use a regular fundraising cycle while others adopt the cycles associated with specific sources.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING CAPITALIZATION:
1. Based on the objectives of the fund, what kinds of sources will be blended together to capitalize the NCF?
2. Will the fund utilize innovative sources, such as levies?
3. Will donor funds be allocated to specific activities? (e.g., capacity building, institutional
strengthening, investment)
4. Are there any existing sources that could readily feed into an NCF?
5. Will the size and sources of capitalization impact the size, governance or implementing arrangements of the fund?
6. Are there specific structures necessary to support the fund’s capitalization? (e.g., laws or policies, partnership agreements)
7. Will there be a regular process or cycle for raising funds? How will additional sources be attracted?






































Building on the objectives and capitalization of the NCF, countries must identify the appropriate governance system that will optimize the fund's performance. Establishing governing bodies, decision-making processes and oversight can facilitate efficient management of the fund in order to drive resources toward implementation.
First, a country must consider the scope of the NCF's governance. If the NCF has a horizontal structure, the governance system should be inclusive of stakeholders and provide coordination among partners. If the NCF is a vertical institution, the governance arrangements may require more stringent reporting and management structures.







GOVERNING BODIES






As discussed previously, many NCFs have a set of governing bodies that make decisions on fund management and strategic direction. The bodies within the governance system must have clear roles that effectively support the NCF without adding increased burden or bottlenecks in the programming cycle. The scope of the bodies should align with the scope of the objectives. An NCF that supports a comprehensive low-emission, climate-resilient development strategy will require a governance system that is equally compre- hensive. On the other hand, if an NCF supports a more targeted objective with limited stakeholders, then the scope of the gover- nance system could also be limited.
Though not required, many NCFs have a high-level steering committee, chaired by the government, which provides guid- ance and oversight to the fund. The steering committee is usually supported by a technical group that provides a substantive review of proposals to the NCF, and by a secretariat that conducts day-to- day operations. A technical group is made up of substantive experts who evaluate project proposals and provide recommendations to the steering committee. The secretariat schedules meetings, corre- sponds with stakeholders, prepares documentation for meetings Both play an important role in supporting the steering committee
Some governments may have existing bodies, frameworks or systems in place that can serve as portions of the governance structure. A previously established inter-ministerial climate change committee, for example, can take on the role of the steering committee. Or, an existing body within a government ministry may also provide technical expertise or secretariat services. Moreover, when multiple environ- ment or climate change funds exist in a country, the governance structure of one fund can support the operations of others.
Guidelines pertaining to representation on an NCF’s governing bodies should be established during the design phase. Many governments choose to have representatives from the sources and implementers, as well as the trustee, on the steering committee. This can help to ensure that all parts of the fund are coordinated and streamlined. Representation guidelines should also carefully outline the role of non- government stakeholders. Depending on the objectives of the fund, non-government representatives can have decision-making abilities alongside the government, or they may participate as observers.

























SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF FUNDING PROPOSALS
The process for submitting and approving proposals should be closely linked to the roles of the governing bodies. Identifying who can submit proposals and who approves them will establish the lifecycle of a project proposal. For example, the China CDM Fund is governed by an inter-ministerial board made up of the Ministry of Finance, National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Agriculture and China Meteorological Administration. The collection, management and use of the funds are the responsibility of a Management Centre affiliated with the Ministry of Finance. Projects are submitted to the Management Centre which then sends them to the NDRC for review and recommendations. The recommendations are then sent to the entire board for approval.
As demonstrated by this example, the relationships between governing bodies should be clarified to ensure that decision-making is efficient. In many cases, proposals are received by the secretariat, reviewed by a technical group and the technical group's recommendations are forwarded to the steering committee for approval. Each body has a defined role to support the decision-making process. Ultimate oversight and of the fund must also be clarified. For example, in many NCFs, the Steering Committee is responsible for the delivery of the fund. In other NCFs, a government body or other agent may have this role.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR INSTILLING EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE:
1. What governing bodies are necessary to ensure efficient operations of the fund?
Who reports to whom?
2. How will any existing inter-ministerial or other high-level national body relate to the fund?
3. Who will be represented in the governing bodies? (e.g., government, private sector, civil society, United Nations, development banks, donors, other development partners)
4. What decision-making process will be put in place for the governing bodies?
5. Who can submit project proposals? To whom do they submit them?
6. What is the project proposal approval process?
7. What safeguards will be put in place to increase effectiveness and efficiency?
8. What body has ultimate oversight over the activities of the NCF? What individual person will lead this body?
9. In the case where there is more than one national environment/climate fund in a country, how do the governing bodies of these funds relate to one another?





























Sound fiduciary management provides the foundation for the efficient movement and tracking of funds flowing to and from the NCF. As the number of sources in the climate finance landscape continues to expand, an NCF must have a system of fiduciary management that accommodates the multiple standards, project cycles and scale of risks of climate change projects.
DEFINING FIDUCIARY ARRANGEMENTS
Fiduciary arrangements facilitate relationships between different actors in the NCF structure. An NCF could be potentially coordinating the disbursement of funds to multiple implementers that have different fiduciary standards from the NCF and from each other. It is critical that decision-makers consider how fidu- ciary standards will apply to these various actors. Some NCFs choose to have tailored fiduciary standards for different types of implementers or projects. For example, an NCF may wish to have a different set of fiduciary standards for a multilateral implementer than for an implementer from the private sector. They may also wish to have certain fiduciary standards for a large project that differ from those for a smaller project with lower risk.










Some funds have a ""one size fits all"" approach where an NCF sets out fiduciary principles that every implementer must apply to their operations. The standards can be as stringent or flexible as necessary. However, NCF designers should take into account that the various types of stakeholders — government entities, private sector, multilateral entities and others — may have varying degrees of flexibility to adopt these standards.

MANAGER OF FIDUCIARY ARRANGEMENTS
Usually a trustee or administrative agent manages an NCF's transactions and ensures that funds are collected and distributed in a coordinated and effective manner. To do this, the trustee provides a number of fund management services, including receiving contributions from various sources, disbursing funds to each participating entity on behalf of the steering committee (or other decision-making body), investing funds that are not yet disbursed and providing financial reporting. The trustee does not make decisions on what projects should be funded by the NCF. Rather, it holds the funds in an account and receives instructions from the steering committee for the timing and direction of distribution. Often, the trustee coordinates the legal contracts and agreements that underpin the transactions of funds. It ensures that the NCF meets all legal and fiduciary standards for collecting and distributing funds.
A national or international body can serve as the trustee. For some NCFs, the trustee is a national development entity. For instance, the trustee for the Amazon Fund of Brazil is the Brazil National Development Bank (BNDES). BNDES coordinates donations and distributes funds. Other funds, such as Guyana's REDD+ Investment Fund, use the World Bank as their trustee. Still others, such as the Ecuador Yasuni ITT Trust Fund, use the United Nations (UN) system. Importantly, if the body selected as the trustee plays additional roles within the NCF, such as for supporting implementation, the NCF should be designed to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest.
Even if the trustee is an external development partner, NCF designers must clarify the relationship between the trustee and government or domestic financial institutions. A national body may wish to engage with the fiduciary management of the NCF in order to support delivery of funds. This can include oversight functions, capacity building or MRV of funds.
The trustee may provide a number of other administrative services beyond collecting and distributing funds and legal documentation. This may include gathering and disseminating of data on projects to which funds are distributed. Further, some trustees play a critical role in reporting by consolidating progress reports submitted by implementing entities. These updates are distributed along with financial reports to the steering committee or other body.
Almost all trustees require a fee for their services. Fees can range from 1 to 5% of funds managed. Countries should take this into consideration as the agreement with the trustee is established.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
Capacity development can be another critical function of fiduciary management. Many countries begin with an international body as the trustee but plan to transition this role to a domestic entity in the future. For this to occur, it is critical that the trustee work closely with national institutions to strengthen domestic fund management so that countries meet international fiduciary standards. This close part- nership will support a smooth transition from one trustee to another, and will maintain a coordinated, predictable funding stream.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENSURING SOUND FIDUCIARY MANAGEMENT:
1. How will the trustee be identified? Can a government entity serve as the trustee? Is an external development partner required?
2. Other than acting as a trustee, how will the government or domestic financial institution engage with the financial management of the fund?
3. What services will the trustee provide? (e.g., fund management, legal, reporting)
4. How can conflicts of interest between the trustee and implementers be avoided?
5. What is the relationship between the trustee and the governing/implementing bodies?
6. What fees will the trustee require?
7. If the trustee will transition to another agent in the future, what capacity development activities should be undertaken?








































2.6 1 Key Decision 5: Supporting Efficient
( Implementation Arrangements



Implementation arrangements — the processes and agents set in place to implement climate change programming — must support the objectives of the NCF and align closely with the other key design decisions.
SCOPE OF IMPLEMENTATION
Identifying what kinds of programmatic instruments — such as grants or loans — will be used to implement the projects establishes the scope of implementation. While many NCFs collect funds and then distribute them as grants, others have diversified their activities to include low-cost loans. For example, the Thailand Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund distributed a pool of government funds to private banks which then provided low-cost loans for energy efficiency. Once the loans were repaid, the money became available for new loans. This continual repayment of the initial loan cycle has supported additional loans.



There are many options for identifying the programmatic instru- ments, such as grants and loans, for delivery of NCF funds. Governments should take stock of their legal and financial tools in order to identify what types of services the NCF can provide. The role of national banks should be considered, as the ability for the NCF to capitalize lending institutions will have implications for the financial management of the fund. In order to provide loans, the bank would need to meet international fiduciary standards, and risk and profit sharing arrangements with the NCF would need to be established.
IMPLEMENTERS
Selecting implementers for an NCF should occur in a systematic and transparent way. For many NCFs, project implementers are approved or accredited by the steering committee and can then apply for funding for specific projects. If project applications are approved, the steering committee directs the trustee to release the funds to the implementing entity.
Using the NCF objectives as a guide, a number of organizations or bodies can serve as implementing entities. NCFs can specify that implementation should be carried out by a government ministry or other agent, similar to the manner in which the Adaptation Fund allows accredited entities to directly access funds for implementation. Other options include United Nations agencies, development banks, civil society or the private sector to deliver activities.

Depending on the objectives of the fund, implementation can also occur by using combinations of these actors through, for example, public-private partnerships. Arrangements like this support the objectives of the fund by establishing flexible systems to ensure that implementation is coordinated and efficient.
As with the trustee, implementers require a fee for their services. Fees can range from 5 to 13% of the projects’ costs.
ALIGNING IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
With all implementers, it is critical that the programmatic cycle is as streamlined as possible to avoid potential “double” project cycles where the NCF would have one project cycle and the implementers another. Projects must be able to move through the system as efficiently as possible in order to avoid unnecessary delays or bottlenecks.




































Further, given that many NCFs will operate alongside international climate funds such as the Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund, or other funds at the national or subnational level, it is important that an NCF's implementing arrangements align with the implementing arrangements of other funds. This will reduce transaction costs and should contribute to knowledge sharing, since some implementers under the NCF may also be implementers under other funds.
It is worth noting that, in some funds, the recipient of the fund and the implementer are separate entities. Some NCFs distribute funds to government bodies that sub-contract the implementation work. These systems should be aligned to ensure effective and efficient delivery.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUPPORTING EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS:
1. What kinds of programmatic instruments will be used? (e.g., grants, loans)
2. Can the fund capitalize lending institutions to support implementation? What does this mean for financial management and fiduciary standards? What does this mean for risk and profit sharing?
3. How will the implementing entities be identified? What criteria are necessary?
4. What is the relationship between the fund and the implementers?
5. How will the fund engage with the private sector to encourage innovative investment opportunities?
6. How can efficient delivery of funds be supported?
7. Who has oversight and legal responsibility over implementation?
8. How will the implementing arrangements relate to those of other domestic and international funds?
9. What fees will implementing entities require?
















Key Decision 6: Facilitating Effective Monitoring, Reporting and Verification
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) is a critical component of an NCF. MRV enables the NCF to ensure that results are being delivered, and to collect lessons learned from implementation that will further refine and improve NCF operations.
The NCF should have unambiguous appraisal and performance criteria. Each stakeholder responsible for providing information on the activities of the NCF must have clear guidelines and standards. Public infor- mation systems can often support the dissemination of information.
PROGRAMMATIC AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
Two types of reporting are necessary. First, the activities implemented must be reviewed and data submitted on the results of those activities. Generally, this is conducted in a bottom-up manner by the implementers, which report activities to one of the governing bodies. However, in some NCFs the governing bodies may collect data in a top-down manner by visiting project sites, carrying out evalua- tions or commissioning audits.
In the case of project reporting, MRV should be systematized across the NCF. Guidelines and templates should be established so each implementer reports on a similar set of metrics. This data should be collected by one governing body that can compile the information for further analysis and identification of best practices. Also, institutional arrangements, including the roles of who will be conducting the MRV and who will be compiling the information, should be clarified.
Second, the status of the finances of the NCF must be reported by the trustee. The trustee often provides this information to the secretariat or steering committee on a regular basis. An NCF may choose to monitor the status of its finances through a series of regular reports or using web-based financial tracking tools. This real-time tracking supports transparency and access to information.
ALIGNING MRV SYSTEMS
Similar to the implementing arrangements, MRV systems should align with other domestic and global climate change funds, as well as any MRV requirements of NAMAs, NAPs and other relevant mecha- nisms. This helps the NCF MRV system to be cost-effective, robust and to minimize the reporting burden on NCF implementers.
NCF MRV systems should also be aligned within the fund to ensure that there are clear roles for oversight and audit functions. The body with legal responsibility over implementation and achieving results should be identified and should ensure that the MRV systems optimize the use of existing national systems.























Moreover, some NCFs may wish to use MRV as a way to incentivize results. By aligning MRV with project effectiveness, NCFs can use the information collected as a basis for future funding for the project. For example, in the case of performance-based funds, projects receive initial funding but future support is based on the results achieved. This model can promote accountability and provide incentives for recipients to use funds efficiently.
CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
Many MRV systems are new to governments and project implementers that have not been a part of previous MRV systems. Importantly, any MRV mechanisms established should provide tools,
                                  methodologies, training and knowledge sharing to help countries strengthen their technical and institutional capacity for developing effective MRV systems.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR FACILITATING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION:
1. Can the NCF MRV system be built upon any existing systems (e.g., MRV for NAMAs)?
2. What type of programmatic or financial information should be reported? How often should information be reported and to whom should the reports be sent?
3. How should MRV results be linked to project effectiveness? (e.g., pay-for-performance options)
4. Will audits be undertaken? By whom?
5. Who will oversee the entire MRV process?
6. What types of guidance materials are available or need to be created? What MRV capacity building activities should be undertaken?

Consolidating Inputs into Term Sheets
To support efficient, transparent and robust NCF design, UNDP recommends consolidating the design decisions of an NCF into a term sheet organized to capture of the different components featured in this guidebook. A term sheet is a document that outlines critical pieces of information about the design and operations of the fund, including the objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary manage- ment, implementation arrangements and MRV. Capturing the objectives and the functional attributes in this way can help to clearly define the scope and administration of the fund so that it effectively supports country objectives. An annotated example term sheet is in Figure 5.
While many NCF term sheets follow a similar structure, the decision points in a term sheet can be tailored to accommodate NCF components that support national needs and priorities. By consolidating design decisions on the components of the fund, the term sheet helps to outline the project cycle and reporting arrangements. It also provides a means to codify agreements regarding fees charged by the trustee and implementing entities, if applicable.
Importantly, term sheets can be used to facilitate engagement with stakeholders during the design process. By outlining each element of the NCF, the document can serve as a structure for discussion and help internal and external stakeholders contribute specific and targeted inputs.
The information captured in the term sheet can also provide a basis for agreement among fund participants. The term sheet can help formalize relationships between NCF sources, governing bodies, implementers and recipients. It can also outline the flow of funds, as well as the decision-making systems that shape the relationships between the fund’s participants (e.g., who reports to whom and how funds are allocated). By codifying this information, the term sheet identifies and clarifies roles, responsibilities and expectations for each part of the NCF.
Through experience, UNDP has learned that term sheets provide a simple, step-by-step tool that can be used as a basis for discussion and agreement throughout the life of the NCF.











































Chapter 3: UNDP Trust Fund Advisory and Management Services
UNDP and National Climate Funds
UNDP has broad experience as a trust fund administrator and as an implementation service provider. UNDP administers a large pool of single-country and thematic UNDP Trust Funds, supports an increasing number of UN Multi-Donor Trust Funds and provides implementation services to several key global environment trust funds. Leveraging this experience, UNDP also provides advisory services to countries for the establishment of national environment, climate and biodiversity funds. Chapter 3 of this guidebook presents an overview of on-going UNDP activities as a trust fund administrator, administrative agent for UN Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs), implementing entity and technical advisor for National Climate Funds.
3.1 I UNDP Administered Funds
As the UN development network, present in 176 countries and territories, UNDP administers over 750 Trust Funds. These trust funds include:
• Single-country Trust Funds that operate at the national level (e.g., Women and Children's Rights in Ukraine)
• Geographic Trust Funds that encompass a region of countries (e.g., Fostering Knowledge Transfer in Disaster Preparedness/Risk Reduction within the Caribbean), a continent (e.g., Integrated Water Management in Africa) or a region at the sub-national level (e.g., Micro-Projects in Northwest Provinces of Cambodia)
• Thematic Trust Funds that address an issue globally (e.g., Climate Change, Poverty and Environment, HIV/AIDS)
Of the trust funds administered worldwide by UNDP, 58% are single country funds, 25% are geographic trust funds, and 17% are thematic trust funds (Figure 6). UNDP has worked closely with governments, national and sub-national government bodies, inter-ministerial groups and other stakeholders to support the funds to ensure that the funds provide a flexible, coordinated system for delivering results. UNDP's partner network is extensive, working alongside UN agencies, development banks, the private sector and civil society organizations, and draws from a wide breadth of donors by partnering with countries, foundations and the private sector.
UNDP supports trust funds as a valuable tool to facilitate south-south cooperation. Lessons learned from one trust fund can be applied to the others; UNDP works to ensure that experiences are exchanged between and among countries. Knowledge sharing and policy dialogues assist in the development and delivery of programming, and are key components of UNDP's work in administering trust funds.























3.2 UN Multi-Donor Trust Funds
 UNDP’s portfolio includes over $5 billion in more than 45 country-level and global MDTFs and over 25 Joint Programmes (JPs), administered through a specialized unit UNDP Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) Office. MDTFs and JPs are important tools to support specific country and/or global level strategic priorities that may be defined in national plans, UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs), and “Delivering as One” Frameworks. These funds support country-driven and UN-supported work in more than 80 countries with contributions from over 60 donors and development partners. They support a wide range of objectives, ranging from transition and reconstruction actions to development and environmental issues.
MDTFs and JPs are UN-based funds that respond to the needs on the ground, as defined by the relevant government partners and the UN Country Team. Once a fund is established, it enables the UN system to quickly deploy the technical, operational and administrative capacities of the UN and the expeditious approval and implementation of projects and programmes. MDTFs are established according to the guidance provided in the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) Guidance Note on Establishing, Managing and Closing Multi-Donor Trust Funds and generally relies on UN entities to implement projects and programmes.
















The MDTFs are governed through MDTF Steering Committees, which at the country level are normally co-chaired by the Resident Coordinator and national government, and include participating UN organizations and often donors and other stakeholders. One example, the UNDG Iraq Trust Fund, has received over $1.4 billion in contributions from 26 donors, including both developed and developing countries. It has supported 212 projects since 2004 and delivered results through 16 implementers in eight thematic sectors. Another type of fund, the MDG Achievement Fund, includes $700 million that is delivered in more than 50 countries.
Though differing in size and structure, each of the funds supports national ownership and capacity building. Further, UNDP supports the UN and other partners by providing fund management services that enhance the coherence, effectiveness and efficiency of the UN system. By providing a transparent and accountable framework for MDTFs, UNDP promotes coordination across UN agencies toward the efficient delivery of results.
Importantly, UNDP also has the systems in place to help countries manage trust funds as they evolve and grow. For example, the global UN-REDD Programme Fund helps developing countries to build capacity to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The programme started in 2008 with $12 million from a single donor. Only four years later, it had expanded to a $97 million fund funded by four donors. UNDP was able to help the fund navigate this dramatic growth by managing contributions and leveraging initial funds to attract increased investment.
For MRV of funds, UNDP provides support through a web-based reporting portal that offers full public disclosure and visibility to all partners. Information relating to donor contributions, transfers and expenditures, approved projects and activities, external reviews and evaluations, official notices and publications are all housed in one accessible location in a full range of information formats. This information documents where, to whom and how much funding has been contributed globally to MDTFs, and tracks the related activities implemented and results achieved. In keeping with UNDP's commitment to transparency, this information is displayed on the MPTF Office GATEWAY in real time directly from UNDP's accounting system (see Figure 7).


UNDP is an implementing agency of some of the largest global environmental trust funds in the world, including the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund, Multilateral Fund, Special Climate Change Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund and Adaptation Fund, The organization currently supports the implementation of an $8 billion portfolio of 1,000 climate change and ecosystems-management projects. As an implementing agency, UNDP provides technical and financial assistance for projects across all thematic areas — including mitigation, adaptation, technology, finance and REDD — and helps countries to put in place the systems that bolster low-emission, climate-resilient develop ment
UNDP also provides support for the implementation of projects under a variety of bilateral funds. For example, under the $92 million Africa Adaptation Programme, UNDP supports 20 countries to develop integrated and comprehensive climate change adaptation actions and resilience plans. The programme ensures that national development processes weigh climate change risks and opportunities in order to secure development gains, UNDP helps countries establish an enabling environment and develop the capacity required to design, finance, implement and monitor long-term and cost-effective adaptation policies and plans.


3.4 ( UNDP National Climate Fund Advisory Services
Leveraging UNDP's experience as a trust fund manager and implementation service provider for global, regional, national and thematic trust funds, UNDP provides advisory services to governments to establish and operate national environment and climate change funds. UNDP's advisory services include support for:
• NCF Design
• Capitalization
• Trustee or Administrative Agent
• Capacity Development
• Implementation
NCF Design — UNDP supports countries to develop and codify operational guidance to ensure streamlined fund delivery. Using the multi-stakeholder approach of Chapter 2, UNDP helps countries to develop detailed term sheets that consolidate the decisions emerging from the design process. In this way, the funds can provide flexible, coordinated and predictable funding toward the achievement of national sustainable development priorities.
Designing funds according to a country's priorities and circumstances is central to UNDP's approach. The objectives of a fund, for example, should align with national goals on climate change, any short-, medium- and long-term climate and development plans, capacities to manage and deliver climate finance and other political and economic considerations. In cases where countries do not have an existing strategy on climate change, or the existing strategy is outdated, UNDP has the tools and guidelines to help countries develop comprehensive strategic and programmatic roadmaps to achieve sustainable low-emission, climate-resilient development.
Ensuring that all relevant stakeholders participate in the design process is an important element of any national fund. UNDP's term sheet approach consolidates stakeholder inputs so that a national fund addresses country-driven priorities as efficiently and effectively as possible. While the questions posed in a term sheet are universal — objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary arrangements, implementing arrangements and MRV — UNDP works to ensure that the answers reflect unique country priorities and circumstances.
UNDP has established teams of technical advisers at the national, regional and global level, as well as administrative and trustee units, to support countries throughout project design and delivery. For more detail on UNDP's support team, please see www.undp.org/climatechange.

Capitalization — Mobilizing resources is a critical part of any national fund. UNDP assists countries with establishing regulatory frameworks for identifying and collecting resources. This includes public, private, multilateral and bilateral sources of finance.
From UNDP's experience, it is imperative that climate finance be used catalytically, leveraging accessible funding sources to spur additional investments in climate change projects. The finance required to support action on climate change is immense and an NCF should be able to collect and blend multiple sources together for maximum benefit. For example, an NCF can use public funds to create enabling investment environments and remove barriers for domestic and foreign investment. In this way, public funds cannot only be leveraged to attract private investment in projects, but the NCF lays the foundation for private investment in the longer term.
UNDP has a number of facilities, tools and platforms to help countries put capitalization systems in place to attract and manage new sources of finance. One programme, the MDG Carbon Facility, works together with commercial banks to provide the private sector in developing countries with a direct link to carbon markets. Another programme, Capacity Development for Decision-Makers to Address Climate Change, helps countries to conduct investment and financial flow analyses so they can get an accurate picture of what types of finance are needed to accomplish their climate change goals.
UNDP also assists countries as they consider using innovative sources of finance. Establishing a levy on specific industries, for example, can require a number of regulatory and financial frameworks. UNDP helps countries to explore these options.
Trustee or Administrative Agent — As a trustee/administrative agent, UNDP provides transparent and accountable fund management services to enhance coherence, effectiveness and efficiency. UNDP provides the full range of financial services, including receiving contributions from sources, administering funds received, disbursing funds to each implementing organization in accordance with the objectives and guidance of the fund, consolidating statements and reports and providing final reporting.
UNDP provides a ""one stop shop"" for all of the financial and legal activities of the NCF. Legal documents, such as partnership agree-
ments, memorandums of understanding and other agreements that codify partnerships and relationships with stakeholders, can be held by UNDP. Furthermore, contributors, governing bodies, implementers and recipients can find information on the collection, management and disbursement of funds from one unified source. This supports transparency, efficiency and accountability.


UNDP, when acting as the administrative agent/trustee, only disburses funds when directed by the governing bodies. The administrative agent/trustee does not make any funding or implementation decisions at anytime.
Capacity Development — As a capacity building organization, UNDP works to ensure that any national fund strengthens the capacity of governing bodies, implementers, recipients and other stakeholders, enhancing their ability to manage the operations of the fund and to support delivery of projects. This promotes a country's ownership and ensures that the operations of the fund fully align with national priorities.
This is especially important as countries engage with national implementation and ""direct access"" of climate finance. UNDP's services for NCFs strengthen national institutions' ability to collect, blend, coordinate and account for climate finance, helping them align with international fiduciary standards. Through NCFs, countries can build the national systems that better position them to manage climate change programming and meet the standards necessary for national implementation under the Adaptation Fund and other sources.
Implementation — As discussed above, UNDP also provides implementation services at the national, regional and global levels, and can support the implementation of NCF programmes in different capacities. Importantly, UNDP has systems in place to manage its role as an administrative agent/trustee alongside its role as an implementer of climate change projects. To avoid any real or perceived conflict of interest between its fund-management and programmatic roles, UNDP firewalls its administrative and implementing functions. This helps to keep the government in the driving seat and establish clear roles to support the efficient delivery of funds to achieve results on the ground.



Conclusion
Countries have immense opportunities to utilize climate finance — more sources of funding exist than ever before to help countries achieve their climate change objectives. However, in order for this increased funding to achieve real results, countries must be equipped to effectively access and channel funds toward their climate and development priorities. It is critical that the increased number of funding sources are matched with an increase in a country's ability to collect, blend, coordinate and account for climate finance.
As this guidebook demonstrates, National Climate Funds are a useful tool that can support countries to optimize their access to and management of climate finance. NCFs are nationally-owned and nationally- managed so that a country can collect the sources that are right for them, blend them together, impie ment activities in a manner that accomplishes their priorities and set up a nationally-relevant system to account for the results of their work. NCFs put countries in the driving seat for transforming their economies and achieving low-emission, climate-resilient development.
Based on UNDP's experience in the administration of over 750 trust funds at the national, global and regional levels, and 40 Multi-Donor Trust Funds around the world, there is a set of key decisions that a country must consider when designing and establishing an NCF:
• Defining the objectives
• Identifying capitalization
• Instilling effective governance
• Ensuring sound fiduciary management
• Supporting efficient implementation arrangements
• Facilitating effective monitoring, reporting and verification
Once key decisions have been made, a country will have crafted the components of its NCF; these components will provide a structure that helps to drive resources toward a country's climate and development priorities. A carefully considered and well-designed NCF will ensure that systems are in place to facilitate the flow of funds and monitoring, reporting and verification. Further, support and coordination should underscore all of an NCF's components, ensuring that efficient decision-making supports the implementation of projects and programmes that achieve the NCF's goals.
Importantly, NCFs are not one-size-fits-all. Each NCF must be tailored to country priorities and realities. They should be firmly rooted in, and aligned with, existing national strategies, frameworks, systems and other initiatives on climate change. NCFs must also define the fund's relationship to other global funds and programmes so that the NCF can make the best use of available resources and avoid duplicating other efforts.

In UNDP's experience, the use of a term sheet helps to define the design and operations of the NCF by capturing the key considerations of each of its components. As a document that outlines critical pieces of information about the operations and scope of the fund, a term sheet supports an efficient, transparent and robust NCF design. While the questions posed by a term sheet are universal, the answers will be unique to each country.
Stakeholder engagement is a critical part of the design and establishment of NCFs. Government, civil society, academia, the United Nations, development banks, the private sector and others can contribute specific and targeted inputs so that the NCF operates as efficiently as possible. Term sheets are also useful for this purpose — they can provide a structure for stakeholder engagement, ensuring that all voices are heard, and that roles, responsibilities and expectations are defined clearly.
Capacity development is also a key element of any NCF. The NCF should support on-going capacity development of governing bodies, implementers, the trustee and other stakeholders so that they can drive results and continue to build robust systems that address the country's climate change priorities over time. Capacity development is especially important as more global funds include opportunities for countries to access funds directly. Countries can use NCFs to strengthen national institutions and align with international fiduciary standards so that they can meet the criteria associated with those funds.
Throughout this guidebook, a number of existing NCFs have been featured. It is important to learn from their experiences and build on lessons from their NCF design and establishment process. A key lesson applicable to all countries designing an NCF is to be very clear about what the NCF should accomplish. Countries must realistically assess their needs: in some cases the NCF should be very broad and attract many different types of funding sources; in others, a more targeted NCF is necessary to focus on a key priority for the country. The targeted NCF can be capitalized by a limited number of funding sources in order to decrease administrative and operating costs.
NCFs help countries to manage climate finance and to achieve their sustainable development goals. By creating an NCF, a country sets in place a system that efficiently collects, blends, coordinates and accounts for climate finance, helping it to take advantage of the increased number of climate funding sources available. In this way, NCFs help countries to manage climate finance catalytically and build a system that supports low-emission and climate-resilient development now and in the future.





Glossary of Terms




Adaptation - Initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems to actual or expected climate change effects.
Adaptation Fund - The Adaptation Fund was established by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Fund is financed with 2% of the Certified Emission Reduction issued for projects of the Clean Development Mechanism and other sources of funding.
Additionality - Reduction in emissions by sources or enhancement of removals by sinks that is additional to any that would occur in the absence of a Joint Implementation (Jl) or a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project activity as defined in the Kyoto Protocol Articles on Jl and CDM.
Capitalization - Refers to the types of resources that the fund would collect. International, national, public and private funds can all be relevant for an NCF.
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) - Defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, the CDM is intended to meet two objectives: (1) to assist parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the convention; and (2) to assist parties included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments.
Climate change - Any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or because of human activity.
Climate variability - Variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate of all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may result from natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability) or from variations in natural or anthropogenic external processes (external variability).
Conference of the Parties (COP) - The supreme body of the UNFCCC, comprised of countries with the right to vote that have ratified or acceded to the convention.
Direct access - A funding modality in which domestic entities can access funds to implement climate change programmes and projects. Financial transfers are made directly from the funding source to the domestic entity for implementation.
Ecosystem -A system of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment.
Emissions trading - A market-based approach to achieving emissions reduction objectives. It allows those reducing GFIG emissions below their emission cap to use or trade the excess reductions to offset emissions at another source inside or outside the country.

Fiduciary management - Fiduciary management allows for the efficient movement and tracking of funds flowing to and from an NCF. This can include establishing fiduciary standards that apply to all monetary transactions.
 Fossil fuels - Carbon-based fuels from fossil hydrocarbon deposits, including coal, peat, oil and natural gas.
 Global Environment Facility (GEF) - Established in 1991, the GEF is a financial mechanism under the UNFCCC that provides grants to countries for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer and persistent organic pollutants.
 Green Climate Fund (GCF) - Established at COP 16 in Cancun, Mexico, the GCF joined the GEF as a financial mechanism under the UNFCCC. The GCF will support climate change projects, programmes and policies and other activities in developing countries using thematic funding windows. The exact design arrangements and structure of the GCF will be negotiated through a Transitional Committee with the goal of approving the modalities at COP 17 in 2011.
 Greenhouse gases - Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, the atmosphere and clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor (H20), carbon dioxide (C02), nitrous oxide (N20), methane (CH4) and ozone (03) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine- containing substances. These are dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Besides carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulfur hexafluoride, hydro fluorocarbons and per fluorocarbons.
 Governance of an NCF - Governance includes bodies, decision-making processes and oversight functions that facilitate efficient management of an NCF.
 Implementation - Implementation includes the processes and agents set in place to carry out NCF programmes and projects. This can include programmatic instruments (e.g., grants or loans), processes for selecting implementing entities and oversight and legal responsibilities.
 Innovative sources of climate finance - Innovative sources refers to a range of non-traditional mechanisms to raise new and additional funds for development and climate activities, such as taxes on transport or financial transaction. The term is also sometime used to define innovative public financial schemes such as public-private equity funds or government-sponsored loan guarantee funds to scale up development action.
Chapter 6: Annex






 Kyoto Protocol - The Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC was adopted at the Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in 1997 in Kyoto. It contains legally binding commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Annex B countries agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012.
The Kyoto Protocol came into force on 16 February 2005.
 Market barriers - In the context of climate change mitigation, market barriers are conditions that prevent or impede the diffusion of cost- effective technologies or practices that would mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
 Mitigation - Technological change and substitution that reduces resource inputs and emissions per unit of output.
 Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) - MRV refers to the ability to quantify the results of an activity or funding commitment and provide this information to others. The information can then be independently checked for accuracy and reliability.
 Montreal Protocol - The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in Montreal in 1987, and subsequently adjusted and amended in London (1990), Copenhagen (1992), Vienna (1995), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). It controls the consumption and production of chlorine-and bromine-containing chemicals that destroy stratospheric ozone, such as chlorofluorocarbons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and many others.
 Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) - MDTFs are a type of NCF that is generally established to support specific country and/or global level strategic priorities that may be defined in national plans, UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs), ""Delivering as One"" Frameworks, etc. Generally, an MDTF relies on UN agencies for implementation services.
 Nationally-Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) - Established under the UNFCCC process, a NAMA refers to a set of policies and actions countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) - Under the UNFCCC process, NAPAs provide a process for Least Developed Countries to identify priority activities based on urgent and immediate needs to adapt to climate change. LDCs submit NAPAs to the UNFCCC and can receive funding to implement the priority activities identified.
 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) - While NAPA focus on urgent and immediate needs, a NAP targets medium and long-term adaptation needs. NAPs can be undertaken by all countries.

National Climate Fund (NCF) - An NCF is a mechanism that supports countries to direct finance toward climate change projects and programmes by facilitating the collection, blending, coordination of, and accounting for climate finance. NCFs provide a country-driven system that can support climate change goal setting and strategic programming, oversee climate change project approval and implementation, measure performance, offer policy assurance and financial control of climate change funds, and assist with partnership management.
National Implementing Entity (NIE) - Under the Adaptation Fund,
NIEs are the national legal entities that have been identified by the Adaptation Fund Board as meeting the fiduciary standards adopted by the Board and accredited as NIE. NIEs can access funds directly for implanting climate change projects.
Objectives of an NCF - Objectives are the strategic goals of an NCF.
This can include mitigation, adaptation, REDD, capacity building, technology or other programmatic priorities, as well as management priorities such as attracting private sector investment.
Private equity - Investors focus on later stage and more mature technology or projects, and generally expects to exit their investment and make their returns in a three to five-year timeframe.
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) - A government service or private business venture which is funded and operated through a partnership of government and one or more private sector companies. PPP involves a contract between a public sector authority and a private party, in which the private party provides a public service or project and assumes substantial financial, technical and operational risk in the project.
Resilience - Refers to three conditions that enable a social or ecological system to absorb change and not fundamentally fall apart. The conditions are: ability to self-organize, ability to buffer disturbance and capacity for learning and adapting.
Secretariat - A secretariat manages day-to-day operations of the NCF, including scheduling meetings, collecting documents and liaising with the Steering Committee, Technical Committee, Implementers and other agents.
Stakeholders - Those who have interests in a particular decision, either as individuals or as representatives of a group. This includes people who can influence a decision as well as those affected by it. Decision makers are also stakeholders.
Standards - Set of rules or codes mandating or defining product performance (e.g., grades, dimensions, characteristics, test methods and rules for use).
Steering Committee - A Steering Committee of an NCF makes decisions on the disbursal of funds and oversees the high-level activities, including policy and operational guidelines, strategic direction and reporting. This group is often made up of multiple government ministries, such as environment, planning and finance, and representatives from civil society, the United Nations, development banks, private sector or other partners.
Subsidy - Direct payment or a tax reduction issued by the government to a private party for implementing a practice the government wishes to encourage.
Sources of climate finance - A number of sources can contribute to an NCF, including public domestic finance, public multilateral finance, public bilateral finance, private sources and innovative sources.
Technical Committee - The Technical Committee supports the Steering Committee by providing substantive reviews of project proposals and making recommendations for which proposals should receive funding.
Term sheet - A term sheet is a non-binding financial agreement that describes each of the elements of an NCF. It provides a concise framework for the objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary management, implementation arrangements and MRV of an NCF so that the basic conditions under which the NCF will operate are clearly defined. While many NCF term sheets follow a similar structure, they can be tailored to accommodate NCF design elements that support national needs and priorities.
Trustee/Administrative Agent - the trustee of an NCF provides a number of important fund management services, including receiving and holding contributions from various sources, disbursing funds to each participating entity on behalf of the steering committee (or other decision-making body) and providing financial reporting. Often, the trustee coordinates the legal contracts and agreements that underpin the transactions of funds. It ensures that the NCF meets all legal and fiduciary standards for collecting and distributing funds.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC; Convention) - The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and the European Economic Community. Its ultimate objective is the 'stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system/ It contains commitments for all parties. Under the Convention, parties included in Annex I aimed to return greenhouse gas emission not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
Vulnerability - The degree to which an individual, group or system is susceptible to harm due to hazards or stress, and its (in)ability to cope, recover or fundamentally adapt (become a new system or become extinct).

Foreword
Climate change is one of the most pressing threats to development today. Addressing climate change requires that countries transform their economies and grow in a different way — climate and development planning must be integrated so that policies and actions across multiple sectors and scales lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduce vulnerability to climate shocks and deliver poverty reduction gains.
The good news is that countries have new and expanded opportunities to finance climate change actions — billions from the public and private sectors will be channeled toward climate activities. In order for countries to take advantage of these opportunities, however, the right institutional and financial mechanisms must be in place so that resources are directed efficiently toward national climate and development priorities.
An important tool for countries to manage climate finance is a National Climate Fund NCFs are nation- ally-driven and nationally-owned funds that help countries to collect climate finance from a variety of sources, coordinate them, blend them together and aoiount for them. In this way, countries are in the driving seat and can make informed choices fo r how direct resources toward activities that deliver results on the ground
This guidebook is part of a series of practical guida nee documents and toolkits to support national and sub-national governments to achieve low-emission, climate-resilient development It provides information based on UNDP's decades of experience in delivering climate change programming in order to help countries design and establish an NCF that is tailored to their priorities and builds on existing governance, policy and fiscal framework and systerrs.
It is my hope that this guidebook will contribute to the ongoing efforts of countries to manage climate change finance and that it will support countries to be more equipped to achieve transformational change whereby positive develop ment and poverty reduction are achieved and sustained over time.

Overview
Overview
By pledging $30 billion in climate change finance by 2012 and up to $100 billion annually by 2020, governments have ushered in a new era of funding for climate change. Only ten years ago, climate finance was managed by a small number of large funds associated with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. Today, there has been an explosion of public, private, bilateral and multilateral sources that offer countries new opportunities to address their climate and development needs.
While this new landscape of climate change funds provides increased resources, it also brings increased complexity. Requirements, processes and reporting can differ among the funds and countries are faced with the challenge of identifying which funds are appropriate for them, how to collect resources, how to blend them together, how to coordinate the actions funded by them and how to develop the methods to monitor and evaluate the results. Given the diversity of funds, it is critical that countries can build on existing institutions and programmes to manage resources at the national level to support country- driven objectives.
One tool that can help countries respond to these challenges is a National Climate Fund (NCF). An NCF is a mechanism that supports countries to manage their engagement with climate finance by facilitating the collection, blending, coordination of, and accounting for climate finance. NCFs provide a country- driven system that can support climate change goal setting and strategic programming, oversee climate change project approval, measure project implementation and performance, offer policy assurance and financial control of climate change funds and assist with partnership management. NCFs help countries to blend various resources together at the national level, providing a mechanism for shifting power away from traditional top-down fund management to country-level management. A country's climate change objectives are managed and supported from the inside out, not the other way around.
Designing an NCF requires carefully considering its objectives and then crafting a structure that supports the achievement of these objectives. Many NCFs deliver a common set of services, however the exact components and structures to deliver the services vary greatly according to national circumstances and priorities. In other words, the way in which the fund's components are designed shapes how the NCF delivers its support. For example, an NCF capitalized by international and national public finance will collect and blend resources differently that an NCF that relies only on private finance. Tailored fiscal tools and mechanisms will be required to access and channel public and private sources effectively. Further, depending on its capitalization modalities, an NCF may aim to strengthen capacities of national stake holders, including for direct access to climate finance.

Overview
A key lesson learned from UNDP's experience in administering over 750 funds around the world, and in providing trustee and administrative agent services for over $5 billion in multi-donor trust funds, is that a National Climate Fund must be carefully designed to align with national objectives and capacities on climate change. To accomplish this, the design and administration of an NCF can demand extensive time, effort and resources. While this guidebook does not focus on if a country should establish an NCF, it does help countries deepen their understanding of the design choices that are critical to successful NCFs. In the pages that follow, countries can identify the scope and scale of an NCF that matches their needs and priorities and decide if an NCF is right for them.
It is UNDP's hope that this guidebook will help countries to make the most out of the expanding climate change finance landscape. Well-designed NCFs can better equip countries to blend domestic and international, public and private, and concessional loan and grant climate finance at the national level. In this way, NCFs can help countries achieve results and more efficiently and effectively support the transition toward low-emission and climate-resilient development.
Purpose of Guidebook
The purpose of this guidebook is to assist countries in designing a National Climate Fund. It leverages UNDP's experience with funds at the global, regional, national and sub-national levels and shares lessons learned about designing and administering NCFs. It also aims to provide a simple, robust and transparent method for meaningful stakeholder engagement throughout the design process.
Target Audience
The principle audience for this publication is the decision-maker at the national and sub-national levels, as well as domestic and international experts involved in assisting governments in establishing institutions and frameworks to support the management and delivery of climate finance.
Structure of Guidebook
The guidebook is divided into three parts. Chapter 1 provides an overview of NCFs, including the basic goals and functions. Chapter 2 provides a process for designing an NCF, including identifying the objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary management, implementation arrangements and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) structures and systems. Each of these components is accompanied by a series of targeted questions that facilitates decision-making for that component. Chapter 2 also describes UNDP's approach for consolidating stakeholder input by creating a term sheet. Chapter 3 describes UNDP's management and advisory services, and the implementation assistance offered by UNDP. Chapter 4 provides a conclusion and Chapter 5 presents five sample term sheets. The Annex includes a glossary and list of useful resources and websites.





Chapter 1: Overview of National Climate Funds
Overview of National Climate Funds
1.1 | Climate Finance Landscape
Climate change is regarded as a key environment and development challenge for the 21st century. Affecting every continent, climate change impacts threaten to undo progress made toward poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Governments agree that business- as-usual development will not suffice — countries need a new way forward that helps their economies grow in a manner that acknowledges the pressing reality of climate change. Countries must transition toward a new paradigm that supports low-emission, climate-resilient development, shifts production and consumption processes to emit fewer greenhouse gases and promotes sustainable development.
Ushering in a new development paradigm requires a dramatic increase in climate change finance. Recognizing this, governments gathered at the UNFCCC Climate Change Conference in Cancun and pledged $30 billion in ""fast start"" funding — climate funds pledged between 2010 and 2012 — and up to $100 billion annually by 2020. These pledges have been matched by an explosion of public and private funds outside of the UNFCCC process, offering countries new resources to undertake climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. UNDP estimates that, taken together, there are already more than 50 international public funds, 45 carbon markets and 6,000 private equity funds providing climate change finance.1 Each of these public, private, bilateral and multilateral sources offers new opportunities for countries to address their climate and development needs.
The increase in climate change funding opportunities makes it important for countries to consider how to attract and leverage different types of climate change investment, including that from private sources. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that about 40% of the global additional investment needed in climate change finance in 2020 will come from private households, 40% from businesses and the remaining 20% from government.2 With private sector funds outnumbering government funds by an enormous margin, a key challenge for countries will be to use scarce public funds to attract private investment. Public funds — such as those under the UNFCCC — must be leveraged in strategic ways to attract new resources from the private sector.
The dramatic increase in opportunities to access climate finance is matched by equally increasing complexity. The requirements, processes and reporting associated with the many funds can be confusing and overwhelming. Countries are faced with the challenge of how to identify which funds are appropriate for them, how to coordinate the actions funded by them,and how to develop the methods to monitor and evaluate the results.2 Further, countries must also figure out ways to blend funds together so that multiple sources can support climate change initiatives. This will be necessary to finance a complete transformation toward low-emission and climate-resilient development.








































Chapter 1: Overview of National Climate Funds
1.2 Key Goals of a National Climate Fund
One tool that countries can use to meet this challenge is a National Climate Fund (NCF). NCFs are a mechanism that supports countries to direct finance toward climate change projects and programmes. The key goals of an NCF are the collection, blending, and coordination, as well as strengthening national ownership, of climate finance (Figure 2). Each of these goals can be tailored to support country-driven climate change priorities based on national circumstances and realities. NCFs can also serve as a gateway for enhanced capacity building and knowledge sharing among stakeholders.
The NCF's four goals provide the foundation for its programmatic and operational components. First, by collecting and distributing funds to climate change activities that promote national priorities, an NCF
provides a unified engagement point where the government, donors, development partners, civil society and other stakeholders can engage on and make decisions about climate change issues.
Moreover, while traditional mechanisms under the UNFCCC are limited to collecting donor funds or resources under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an NCF can attract a more diverse variety of sources of climate financing. Public, private, multilateral and bilateral funds, as well as innovative sources, can be collected by an NCF for coordinated and streamlined results.
Second, an NCF facilitates the blending of public, private, multilateral and bilateral sources of climate finance. It is rare that one or two funds would be able to cover the costs necessary to transition and entire economy toward low-emission, climate-resilient development. Rather, countries must blend together multiple sources — public, private, multilateral, bilateral — in a coordinated and streamlined way that is strategic and can further catalyze more resources to support action on climate change.
NCFs can be designed to complement and blend sources from the emerging global public climate change financial system. The Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund and the emerging Green Climate Fund will each collect resources and direct them toward climate projects at the regional, national and subnational level. National Climate Funds are not meant to duplicate these financial flows, collect funds from them or increase the burden on countries and implementing entities. Rather, NCFs provide a mechanism that can blend these resources with others resources at the project level. NCFs can provide the means for leveraging public funds to attract private funds and provide national-level coordination among and alongside the global climate finance system.
Third, NCFs can coordinate country-wide climate change activities. The NCF mechanism responds to the need to provide flexible, coordinated and predictable funding to support the achievement of national priorities on climate change and development. In their structure and operations, NCFs are consistent with several principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, including national ownership and alignment with national priorities; harmonization and coordination; effective and inclusive partnerships; and achieving development results and accounting for them.









































1.3 I Common Functions of a National Climate Fund
Once a country decides to establish an NCF, stakeholders must identify the specific and necessary functions of the NCF. Functions should build upon existing mechanisms and systems that support action on climate change. They can include goal setting, strategic programming, capitalization, partnership management, project approval, policy assurance, financial control and performance measurement. Each should be considered carefully. The functions of an NCF influence its components and services. An NCF with ill-designed functions runs the risk of not only failing to reach its goals, but of undermining progress toward low-emission, climate-resilient development.
In UNDP's experience, there are a number of core functions that are common to any funding mechanism, including NCFs. First, an NCF should enhance or provide a system that supports goal setting and the development of programmatic strategies on climate change. By setting in place a process that aligns and supports existing general goals and strategic programmes, the NCF can provide a coordinated supporting structure to a country's national climate and development priorities. Further, by facilitating regular discussions and stakeholder engagement on national climate issues, an NCF can serve as a central body for discussion and decision-making about how the NCF will support national action.
An NCF should provide for fundraising toward climate priorities. Indeed, the capitalization of the NCF — its ability to collect and raise funds — is one of the core functions that make an NCF a useful tool for implementing low-emission, climate-resilient development. As demonstrated in Chapter 2, capitalization can take a variety of forms and can utilize public, private, multilateral, bilateral and innovative sources of finance.
An NCF can provide a mechanism for managing partnerships by clearly defining and coordinating the roles of various climate change stakeholders. The NCF can complement and support the management of relationships with other financing mechanisms, such as those under the UNFCCC or with other multilateral, bilateral, public and private sources. It can also ensure the clear management of the responsibilities of stakeholders at all levels and across climate change initiatives.
NCFs can provide a coordinated project approval and implementation structure for climate change programming. Uniform project cycle guidelines that clearly outline the technical and eligibility requirements support streamlined operations. Well-conceived guidelines can facilitate the transparent approval process of NCF climate change initiatives.
Moreover, an NCF can supply systems to ensure that quality standards are met throughout its operations. NCFs offer policy assurance through social and environmental safeguards, financial controls that ensure fiscal monitoring and reporting and performance measurement that outlines specific performance criteria and then evaluates projects and programmes to ensure that the NCF delivers effectively and efficiently.
The NCF can become an important source of knowledge and information management that consolidates and disseminates lessons from climate change projects and programmes. The exchange of such information can build capacity, help projects implement good practices and spur innovative solutions to implement country-driven priorities on climate change.

Chapter 2: Designing a National Climate Fund

2.1 | Common Components and Structural 1 Overview of a National Climate Fund
Given the diversity of design options, there are a number of key decisions that must be made in order to ensure that an appropriate and effective NCF structure is established that maximizes the delivery of climate finance to support national priorities. Important decisions on each component of the fund must be considered in order for an NCF to achieve the core goals and functions described in Chapter 1. Based on UNDP's experience in the administration of over 750 trust funds and more than 40 multi-donor trust funds, six common components have been identified that provide the basic skeleton for any NCF: objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary management, implementation arrangements and monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV).
Chapter 2 of this guidebook focuses on a step-by-step decision-making process for the design of each component. A description of each component is accompanied by a series of targeted questions that facilitate decision-making for that element. The end of Chapter 2 brings all of these decisions together into a term sheet that facilitates stakeholder engagement and consolidates stakeholder inputs on each component.
NCFs are not ""one-size-fits-all,"" but many funds arrange the components into a common structure to support the delivery of NCF services. The structure includes funding sources, governing bodies, a trustee and implementers. Funding sources provide funds to the NCF while the governing bodies make decisions about the operations of the fund. The trustee manages the transfers of funds to and from the NCF's bank account. Implementers receive funds and ensure activities are undertaken. Each of these agents supports the delivery of actions to achieve the strategic priorities of the NCF.
UNDP has developed a structural overview (Figure 3) that demonstrates how these components can be arranged and the various design questions that must be answered. Resources, coordination, support and MRV flow between sources, governing bodies, the trustee, implementers and recipients. Throughout each component, stakeholders should consider how the NCF will deliver its services and what structural components and design decisions are necessary to support the achievement of the NCF's priorities.

A set of governing bodies is usually at the centre of an NCF. Often, a steering committee or other group makes decisions on the disbursal of funds and oversees the high-level activities of the fund, including policy and operational guidelines, strategic direction and reporting. This group is often made up of multiple ministries, such as environment, planning and finance, and representatives from civil society, the United Nations, development banks, private sector or other partners. The chair person of the steering committee can be a government representative or other participant. The steering committee is usually supported by two other governing bodies, a technical group that provides substantive reviews of project proposals and a secretariat that manages day-to-day operations of the NCF.
In a majority of funds, resources flow from the sources to the trustee, which holds them on behalf of the NCF. When the governing bodies make decisions about how the funds should be allocated, the steering committee will direct the trustee to distribute the funds to the implementing entities. The implementers conduct the projects and the recipients receive the benefits. The implementers then report on their activities to the governing bodies. In the case of loans, the loans will be repaid back to the trustee.
The NCF structure can be tailored to align with its designated functions and national priorities. Depending on the objectives of an NCF, specialized systems can be put in place to manage financial flows. For example, if a fund capitalizes national banks to provide low-cost loans for projects such as renewable energy, it may assign the government as the source of funds and the national banks the trustee. MRV would be conducted by the banks according to their lending criteria. In the case of an NCF using innovative financing mechanisms, such as taxes on bunker fuels, to support activities, the infrastructure must be set up in order to accommodate the collection and distribution of these funds. This kind of flexibility helps each entity associated with the NCF to fulfill the role that best supports the objectives of the fund.
The relationship between the NCF's various bodies must be carefully defined through the design process so that each decision is implemented efficiently and promotes national climate and development objectives. The flows of funds, support and coordination of an NCF should align with its objectives so that the fund can operate smoothly.
Relationships with the private sector and civil society should also be considered and clarified. In some NCFs, the private sector and/or civil society play important roles in the fund's structure, including serving as a donor, an implementer or a representative on a governing body. In cases where the private sector or a civil society group has met the necessary fiduciary standards, they can also serve as the trustee.

















































































Importantly, NCFs must be firmly rooted in national realities. National priorities and circumstances provide an important context for NCF delivery and can lead to opportunities and challenges as an NCF becomes operational. To provide stability, NCFs should take this into account by aligning with national climate change strategies, institutions, frameworks and stakeholders; however, NCFs must also have the flexibility to adjust overtime.
Maintaining both stability and flexibility is imperative to stakeholder engagement. Throughout the design phase of an NCF, stakeholder consultations are critical to ensure that the NCF is robust and effective. Including various government, multilateral, bilateral, private and civil society actors in the development and establishment of the NCF helps to more clearly identify needs and requirements and to accommodate best practices.


















Programmatic and Management Objectives

As a first step in setting up an NCF, a country must identify its strategic goals on climate change and how the NCF will help it to achieve these goals. The NCF may serve the country by driving resources to national climate activities, such as mitigation, adaptation, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), capacity building, technology building or other priorities. An NCF’s objectives may also include attracting private sector investment, or formalizing a system to collect resources from “polluter pays” policies that collect revenue from industry.
An NCF’s objectives provide the foundation for its operations and outcomes. When setting objectives, a country should take into account its national climate and development strategies, as well as other analyses and plans, such as the National Communications, National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Nationally-Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), to identify the priorities of a National Climate Fund. These analyses can bring together current thinking on climate change, as well as focus the NCF on priority issues and sectors where activities can be undertaken in a cost-effective way.
It is critical that objectives take into account the technical and political considerations that may support or hamper the NCF’s progress over time. Thematic priorities, such as increasing renewable energy, must be supported by analyses of the feasibility of increasing investment in that sector. Likewise, to achieve other priorities of the NCF, such as capacity building for direct access to climate funds under the UNFCCC, these aims must be acknowledged, and appropriate and supportive systems be put in place.
Carefully defined objectives must be supported by appropriate functions of the NCF. If an NCF focuses on providing a type of “clearing house” for climate change initiatives, it may not be necessary to develop a complicated financial mechanism. Likewise, if an NCF is to provide low-cost loans to a specific sector, it would not be necessary for the functions of the fund to include extensive coordination systems. A country can select the objectives that match its priorities but must ensure that the objectives are fully supported by the NCF's functions.

ALIGNING OBJECTIVES WITH OTHER PRIORITIES AND FUNDING WINDOWS

These programmatic considerations should be linked closely with fund management considerations and, importantly, how the NCF will relate to other international and domestic climate funds. Some countries may have multiple NCFs that target specific issues — for example, one to provide funding for REDD activities and another for adaptation. Others NCFs may be linked to more comprehensive, national strategies. In Ethiopia, the Carbon-Neutral, Climate-Resilient Economy mission statement sets out how Ethiopia is responding to climate change and how it can transition toward low-carbon growth. The government is considering setting up a national fund to support these activities. The NCF could be a funding arm and all activities under the NCF would link to Ethiopia's mission statement. In this model, the national strategy becomes the roadmap for the NCF.
The scope of the NCF must fully support its programmatic mission. If a country has already acquired funds from a specific source, or funds have been earmarked for a specific activity, then it will be important to ensure that the structure of the NCF can channel this funding appropriately. Similarly, if a country's goals are to optimize its relationships with stakeholders (e.g., the private sector) or funding programmes (e.g., the Clean Development Mechanism) it may be necessary to codify this in the objectives.

FUND TIMELINE
Designing an NCF's objectives must also consider timelines. If a national strategy or other funding mechanism is time-bound, this may affect the timeframe of the NCF. This will be especially important as countries consider their options under the UNFCCC process. For example, if an NCF is designed to attract fast start funding, it is important to align the NCF with the 2012 deadline. Likewise, the longer-term pledges of up to $100 billion per year by 2020 include a variety of sources, including private finance, and an NCF may wish to accommodate these circumstances accordingly. Other NCFs may wish to align themselves with the specific timeframe of a national strategy.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR DEFINING THE OBJECTIVES:
1. What are the national priorities on climate change? Are there short, medium or long-term strategies that the NCF should support (including national strategies, NAMAs, etc.)?
2. Will the fund focus on thematic priorities (e.g., renewable energy) or support broader objectives?
3. How will the objectives of the fund relate to the objectives of other international and domestic funds?
4. What timeframe is most appropriate? Should the NCF be time-bound?
5. What are the expected financial flows to the fund? Have funds already been pledged? Have these funds been earmarked toward a specific activity that should be acknowledged?
6. Are there stakeholders that must be acknowledged in the objectives? (e.g., those associated with a specific industry)
7. Should the objectives acknowledge a relationship with an entity or programme?
(e.g., Clean Development Mechanism)

Building on the fund’s objectives, a country should consider the types of resources that would best capitalize the fund. Indeed, deciding where the funds will come from is one of the most important choices that will shape the NCF. Many sources of finance — including international, national, public and private — can be delivered through an NCF, but they must build on existing frameworks and be supported by appropriate structures to access and channel funding efficiently.
LINKING OBJECTIVES AND CAPITALIZATION
Fund capitalization must be realistic, grounded in the objectives and functions of the NCF. Funds with ambitious objectives must have clear expectations of how the fund will be capitalized and the objectives supported. Designers of NCFs should exercise caution in this regard: expectations of co-financing and leveraging must be based on national circumstances. Likewise, funds with smaller, targeted objectives should not aim to access billions when it is not appropriate for the scope of the NCF.
Generally, if a fund has a broad set of objectives, it usually blends together a broader array of sources than more targeted NCFs. An NCF with wide objectives — for example, supporting all of the activities under a low-emission, climate-resilient development strategy — may aim to collect funds from international and national sources so that a wide variety of activities can be covered. A fund with a more targeted mission will often only focus on a single source, such as those from one bilateral partner.





































INNOVATIVE FINANCING MECHANISMS
A country may also want to consider the use of innovative financing mechanisms to provide capital for an NCF. In this case, an NCF is designed to collect resources from non-traditional sources of finance such as levies on oil or coal production, fees from polluting companies or proceeds from carbon markets. Revenues from these sources are collected by an NCF and then directed toward the programmes and projects that fulfill the goals of the NCF. For example, the Brazil National Fund on Climate Change collects funds from revenue from the oil production industry and channels them toward climate change mitigation and adaptation activities.
Innovative mechanisms require that complementary structures be put in place within the NCF to ensure the efficient collection and delivery of funds. NCFs should have the ability to manage and account for funds coming from these non-traditional sources.

CONSIDERING CONTEXT
With both traditional and innovative sources, it is critical to consider national circumstances in order to optimize capitalization. Laws or policies may be required to access and collect certain types of funding. A tax on an industry, for example, may need to be mandated by a national law that clarifies the rates of taxation.
Understanding and acknowledging national circumstances is especially important when considering the involvement of the private sector. By aligning with existing private sector regulations and incentive structures, for example, the NCF can stimulate and attract private investment by driving public finance toward commercially attractive projects. This helps the NCF to contribute toward sound investment and policy decisions that direct private finance toward activities that address national climate and development priorities.
A country should also consider any available resources that could already feed directly into the NCF or any existing partnerships with donors. A country may wish for the NCF to absorb these resources or partnerships, or to align with them so that activities will be undertaken in a coordinated manner. If the NCF does absorb them, it is important to note whether they are ""earmarked"" toward specific activities — such as capacity building — that will affect the operations of the fund.





The capitalization of the fund has implications for the size, governance and implementation of the fund. For example, if the private sector provides resources to the fund, then it may be necessary to include private sector representatives in the governance system. Furthermore, a number of legal contracts or systems will need to be established in order to collect resources from specific sources. For innovative funds, enacting laws, policies or partnership agreements may also be necessary for the efficient capitaliza- tion of an NCF.
Countries should also consider how additional resources will be raised throughout the life of the fund. Some NCFs use a regular fundraising cycle while others adopt the cycles associated with specific sources.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING CAPITALIZATION:
1. Based on the objectives of the fund, what kinds of sources will be blended together to capitalize the NCF?
2. Will the fund utilize innovative sources, such as levies?
3. Will donor funds be allocated to specific activities? (e.g., capacity building, institutional
strengthening, investment)
4. Are there any existing sources that could readily feed into an NCF?
5. Will the size and sources of capitalization impact the size, governance or implementing arrangements of the fund?
6. Are there specific structures necessary to support the fund’s capitalization? (e.g., laws or policies, partnership agreements)
7. Will there be a regular process or cycle for raising funds? How will additional sources be attracted?






































Building on the objectives and capitalization of the NCF, countries must identify the appropriate governance system that will optimize the fund's performance. Establishing governing bodies, decision-making processes and oversight can facilitate efficient management of the fund in order to drive resources toward implementation.
First, a country must consider the scope of the NCF's governance. If the NCF has a horizontal structure, the governance system should be inclusive of stakeholders and provide coordination among partners. If the NCF is a vertical institution, the governance arrangements may require more stringent reporting and management structures.







GOVERNING BODIES






As discussed previously, many NCFs have a set of governing bodies that make decisions on fund management and strategic direction. The bodies within the governance system must have clear roles that effectively support the NCF without adding increased burden or bottlenecks in the programming cycle. The scope of the bodies should align with the scope of the objectives. An NCF that supports a comprehensive low-emission, climate-resilient development strategy will require a governance system that is equally compre- hensive. On the other hand, if an NCF supports a more targeted objective with limited stakeholders, then the scope of the gover- nance system could also be limited.
Though not required, many NCFs have a high-level steering committee, chaired by the government, which provides guid- ance and oversight to the fund. The steering committee is usually supported by a technical group that provides a substantive review of proposals to the NCF, and by a secretariat that conducts day-to- day operations. A technical group is made up of substantive experts who evaluate project proposals and provide recommendations to the steering committee. The secretariat schedules meetings, corre- sponds with stakeholders, prepares documentation for meetings Both play an important role in supporting the steering committee
Some governments may have existing bodies, frameworks or systems in place that can serve as portions of the governance structure. A previously established inter-ministerial climate change committee, for example, can take on the role of the steering committee. Or, an existing body within a government ministry may also provide technical expertise or secretariat services. Moreover, when multiple environ- ment or climate change funds exist in a country, the governance structure of one fund can support the operations of others.
Guidelines pertaining to representation on an NCF’s governing bodies should be established during the design phase. Many governments choose to have representatives from the sources and implementers, as well as the trustee, on the steering committee. This can help to ensure that all parts of the fund are coordinated and streamlined. Representation guidelines should also carefully outline the role of non- government stakeholders. Depending on the objectives of the fund, non-government representatives can have decision-making abilities alongside the government, or they may participate as observers.

























SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF FUNDING PROPOSALS
The process for submitting and approving proposals should be closely linked to the roles of the governing bodies. Identifying who can submit proposals and who approves them will establish the lifecycle of a project proposal. For example, the China CDM Fund is governed by an inter-ministerial board made up of the Ministry of Finance, National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Agriculture and China Meteorological Administration. The collection, management and use of the funds are the responsibility of a Management Centre affiliated with the Ministry of Finance. Projects are submitted to the Management Centre which then sends them to the NDRC for review and recommendations. The recommendations are then sent to the entire board for approval.
As demonstrated by this example, the relationships between governing bodies should be clarified to ensure that decision-making is efficient. In many cases, proposals are received by the secretariat, reviewed by a technical group and the technical group's recommendations are forwarded to the steering committee for approval. Each body has a defined role to support the decision-making process. Ultimate oversight and of the fund must also be clarified. For example, in many NCFs, the Steering Committee is responsible for the delivery of the fund. In other NCFs, a government body or other agent may have this role.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR INSTILLING EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE:
1. What governing bodies are necessary to ensure efficient operations of the fund?
Who reports to whom?
2. How will any existing inter-ministerial or other high-level national body relate to the fund?
3. Who will be represented in the governing bodies? (e.g., government, private sector, civil society, United Nations, development banks, donors, other development partners)
4. What decision-making process will be put in place for the governing bodies?
5. Who can submit project proposals? To whom do they submit them?
6. What is the project proposal approval process?
7. What safeguards will be put in place to increase effectiveness and efficiency?
8. What body has ultimate oversight over the activities of the NCF? What individual person will lead this body?
9. In the case where there is more than one national environment/climate fund in a country, how do the governing bodies of these funds relate to one another?





























Sound fiduciary management provides the foundation for the efficient movement and tracking of funds flowing to and from the NCF. As the number of sources in the climate finance landscape continues to expand, an NCF must have a system of fiduciary management that accommodates the multiple standards, project cycles and scale of risks of climate change projects.
DEFINING FIDUCIARY ARRANGEMENTS
Fiduciary arrangements facilitate relationships between different actors in the NCF structure. An NCF could be potentially coordinating the disbursement of funds to multiple implementers that have different fiduciary standards from the NCF and from each other. It is critical that decision-makers consider how fidu- ciary standards will apply to these various actors. Some NCFs choose to have tailored fiduciary standards for different types of implementers or projects. For example, an NCF may wish to have a different set of fiduciary standards for a multilateral implementer than for an implementer from the private sector. They may also wish to have certain fiduciary standards for a large project that differ from those for a smaller project with lower risk.










Some funds have a ""one size fits all"" approach where an NCF sets out fiduciary principles that every implementer must apply to their operations. The standards can be as stringent or flexible as necessary. However, NCF designers should take into account that the various types of stakeholders — government entities, private sector, multilateral entities and others — may have varying degrees of flexibility to adopt these standards.

MANAGER OF FIDUCIARY ARRANGEMENTS
Usually a trustee or administrative agent manages an NCF's transactions and ensures that funds are collected and distributed in a coordinated and effective manner. To do this, the trustee provides a number of fund management services, including receiving contributions from various sources, disbursing funds to each participating entity on behalf of the steering committee (or other decision-making body), investing funds that are not yet disbursed and providing financial reporting. The trustee does not make decisions on what projects should be funded by the NCF. Rather, it holds the funds in an account and receives instructions from the steering committee for the timing and direction of distribution. Often, the trustee coordinates the legal contracts and agreements that underpin the transactions of funds. It ensures that the NCF meets all legal and fiduciary standards for collecting and distributing funds.
A national or international body can serve as the trustee. For some NCFs, the trustee is a national development entity. For instance, the trustee for the Amazon Fund of Brazil is the Brazil National Development Bank (BNDES). BNDES coordinates donations and distributes funds. Other funds, such as Guyana's REDD+ Investment Fund, use the World Bank as their trustee. Still others, such as the Ecuador Yasuni ITT Trust Fund, use the United Nations (UN) system. Importantly, if the body selected as the trustee plays additional roles within the NCF, such as for supporting implementation, the NCF should be designed to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest.
Even if the trustee is an external development partner, NCF designers must clarify the relationship between the trustee and government or domestic financial institutions. A national body may wish to engage with the fiduciary management of the NCF in order to support delivery of funds. This can include oversight functions, capacity building or MRV of funds.
The trustee may provide a number of other administrative services beyond collecting and distributing funds and legal documentation. This may include gathering and disseminating of data on projects to which funds are distributed. Further, some trustees play a critical role in reporting by consolidating progress reports submitted by implementing entities. These updates are distributed along with financial reports to the steering committee or other body.
Almost all trustees require a fee for their services. Fees can range from 1 to 5% of funds managed. Countries should take this into consideration as the agreement with the trustee is established.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
Capacity development can be another critical function of fiduciary management. Many countries begin with an international body as the trustee but plan to transition this role to a domestic entity in the future. For this to occur, it is critical that the trustee work closely with national institutions to strengthen domestic fund management so that countries meet international fiduciary standards. This close part- nership will support a smooth transition from one trustee to another, and will maintain a coordinated, predictable funding stream.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENSURING SOUND FIDUCIARY MANAGEMENT:
1. How will the trustee be identified? Can a government entity serve as the trustee? Is an external development partner required?
2. Other than acting as a trustee, how will the government or domestic financial institution engage with the financial management of the fund?
3. What services will the trustee provide? (e.g., fund management, legal, reporting)
4. How can conflicts of interest between the trustee and implementers be avoided?
5. What is the relationship between the trustee and the governing/implementing bodies?
6. What fees will the trustee require?
7. If the trustee will transition to another agent in the future, what capacity development activities should be undertaken?








































2.6 1 Key Decision 5: Supporting Efficient
( Implementation Arrangements



Implementation arrangements — the processes and agents set in place to implement climate change programming — must support the objectives of the NCF and align closely with the other key design decisions.
SCOPE OF IMPLEMENTATION
Identifying what kinds of programmatic instruments — such as grants or loans — will be used to implement the projects establishes the scope of implementation. While many NCFs collect funds and then distribute them as grants, others have diversified their activities to include low-cost loans. For example, the Thailand Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund distributed a pool of government funds to private banks which then provided low-cost loans for energy efficiency. Once the loans were repaid, the money became available for new loans. This continual repayment of the initial loan cycle has supported additional loans.



There are many options for identifying the programmatic instru- ments, such as grants and loans, for delivery of NCF funds. Governments should take stock of their legal and financial tools in order to identify what types of services the NCF can provide. The role of national banks should be considered, as the ability for the NCF to capitalize lending institutions will have implications for the financial management of the fund. In order to provide loans, the bank would need to meet international fiduciary standards, and risk and profit sharing arrangements with the NCF would need to be established.
IMPLEMENTERS
Selecting implementers for an NCF should occur in a systematic and transparent way. For many NCFs, project implementers are approved or accredited by the steering committee and can then apply for funding for specific projects. If project applications are approved, the steering committee directs the trustee to release the funds to the implementing entity.
Using the NCF objectives as a guide, a number of organizations or bodies can serve as implementing entities. NCFs can specify that implementation should be carried out by a government ministry or other agent, similar to the manner in which the Adaptation Fund allows accredited entities to directly access funds for implementation. Other options include United Nations agencies, development banks, civil society or the private sector to deliver activities.

Depending on the objectives of the fund, implementation can also occur by using combinations of these actors through, for example, public-private partnerships. Arrangements like this support the objectives of the fund by establishing flexible systems to ensure that implementation is coordinated and efficient.
As with the trustee, implementers require a fee for their services. Fees can range from 5 to 13% of the projects’ costs.
ALIGNING IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
With all implementers, it is critical that the programmatic cycle is as streamlined as possible to avoid potential “double” project cycles where the NCF would have one project cycle and the implementers another. Projects must be able to move through the system as efficiently as possible in order to avoid unnecessary delays or bottlenecks.




































Further, given that many NCFs will operate alongside international climate funds such as the Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund, or other funds at the national or subnational level, it is important that an NCF's implementing arrangements align with the implementing arrangements of other funds. This will reduce transaction costs and should contribute to knowledge sharing, since some implementers under the NCF may also be implementers under other funds.
It is worth noting that, in some funds, the recipient of the fund and the implementer are separate entities. Some NCFs distribute funds to government bodies that sub-contract the implementation work. These systems should be aligned to ensure effective and efficient delivery.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUPPORTING EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS:
1. What kinds of programmatic instruments will be used? (e.g., grants, loans)
2. Can the fund capitalize lending institutions to support implementation? What does this mean for financial management and fiduciary standards? What does this mean for risk and profit sharing?
3. How will the implementing entities be identified? What criteria are necessary?
4. What is the relationship between the fund and the implementers?
5. How will the fund engage with the private sector to encourage innovative investment opportunities?
6. How can efficient delivery of funds be supported?
7. Who has oversight and legal responsibility over implementation?
8. How will the implementing arrangements relate to those of other domestic and international funds?
9. What fees will implementing entities require?
















Key Decision 6: Facilitating Effective Monitoring, Reporting and Verification
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) is a critical component of an NCF. MRV enables the NCF to ensure that results are being delivered, and to collect lessons learned from implementation that will further refine and improve NCF operations.
The NCF should have unambiguous appraisal and performance criteria. Each stakeholder responsible for providing information on the activities of the NCF must have clear guidelines and standards. Public infor- mation systems can often support the dissemination of information.
PROGRAMMATIC AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
Two types of reporting are necessary. First, the activities implemented must be reviewed and data submitted on the results of those activities. Generally, this is conducted in a bottom-up manner by the implementers, which report activities to one of the governing bodies. However, in some NCFs the governing bodies may collect data in a top-down manner by visiting project sites, carrying out evalua- tions or commissioning audits.
In the case of project reporting, MRV should be systematized across the NCF. Guidelines and templates should be established so each implementer reports on a similar set of metrics. This data should be collected by one governing body that can compile the information for further analysis and identification of best practices. Also, institutional arrangements, including the roles of who will be conducting the MRV and who will be compiling the information, should be clarified.
Second, the status of the finances of the NCF must be reported by the trustee. The trustee often provides this information to the secretariat or steering committee on a regular basis. An NCF may choose to monitor the status of its finances through a series of regular reports or using web-based financial tracking tools. This real-time tracking supports transparency and access to information.
ALIGNING MRV SYSTEMS
Similar to the implementing arrangements, MRV systems should align with other domestic and global climate change funds, as well as any MRV requirements of NAMAs, NAPs and other relevant mecha- nisms. This helps the NCF MRV system to be cost-effective, robust and to minimize the reporting burden on NCF implementers.
NCF MRV systems should also be aligned within the fund to ensure that there are clear roles for oversight and audit functions. The body with legal responsibility over implementation and achieving results should be identified and should ensure that the MRV systems optimize the use of existing national systems.























Moreover, some NCFs may wish to use MRV as a way to incentivize results. By aligning MRV with project effectiveness, NCFs can use the information collected as a basis for future funding for the project. For example, in the case of performance-based funds, projects receive initial funding but future support is based on the results achieved. This model can promote accountability and provide incentives for recipients to use funds efficiently.
CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
Many MRV systems are new to governments and project implementers that have not been a part of previous MRV systems. Importantly, any MRV mechanisms established should provide tools,
                                  methodologies, training and knowledge sharing to help countries strengthen their technical and institutional capacity for developing effective MRV systems.
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR FACILITATING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION:
1. Can the NCF MRV system be built upon any existing systems (e.g., MRV for NAMAs)?
2. What type of programmatic or financial information should be reported? How often should information be reported and to whom should the reports be sent?
3. How should MRV results be linked to project effectiveness? (e.g., pay-for-performance options)
4. Will audits be undertaken? By whom?
5. Who will oversee the entire MRV process?
6. What types of guidance materials are available or need to be created? What MRV capacity building activities should be undertaken?

Consolidating Inputs into Term Sheets
To support efficient, transparent and robust NCF design, UNDP recommends consolidating the design decisions of an NCF into a term sheet organized to capture of the different components featured in this guidebook. A term sheet is a document that outlines critical pieces of information about the design and operations of the fund, including the objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary manage- ment, implementation arrangements and MRV. Capturing the objectives and the functional attributes in this way can help to clearly define the scope and administration of the fund so that it effectively supports country objectives. An annotated example term sheet is in Figure 5.
While many NCF term sheets follow a similar structure, the decision points in a term sheet can be tailored to accommodate NCF components that support national needs and priorities. By consolidating design decisions on the components of the fund, the term sheet helps to outline the project cycle and reporting arrangements. It also provides a means to codify agreements regarding fees charged by the trustee and implementing entities, if applicable.
Importantly, term sheets can be used to facilitate engagement with stakeholders during the design process. By outlining each element of the NCF, the document can serve as a structure for discussion and help internal and external stakeholders contribute specific and targeted inputs.
The information captured in the term sheet can also provide a basis for agreement among fund participants. The term sheet can help formalize relationships between NCF sources, governing bodies, implementers and recipients. It can also outline the flow of funds, as well as the decision-making systems that shape the relationships between the fund’s participants (e.g., who reports to whom and how funds are allocated). By codifying this information, the term sheet identifies and clarifies roles, responsibilities and expectations for each part of the NCF.
Through experience, UNDP has learned that term sheets provide a simple, step-by-step tool that can be used as a basis for discussion and agreement throughout the life of the NCF.











































Chapter 3: UNDP Trust Fund Advisory and Management Services
UNDP and National Climate Funds
UNDP has broad experience as a trust fund administrator and as an implementation service provider. UNDP administers a large pool of single-country and thematic UNDP Trust Funds, supports an increasing number of UN Multi-Donor Trust Funds and provides implementation services to several key global environment trust funds. Leveraging this experience, UNDP also provides advisory services to countries for the establishment of national environment, climate and biodiversity funds. Chapter 3 of this guidebook presents an overview of on-going UNDP activities as a trust fund administrator, administrative agent for UN Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs), implementing entity and technical advisor for National Climate Funds.
3.1 I UNDP Administered Funds
As the UN development network, present in 176 countries and territories, UNDP administers over 750 Trust Funds. These trust funds include:
• Single-country Trust Funds that operate at the national level (e.g., Women and Children's Rights in Ukraine)
• Geographic Trust Funds that encompass a region of countries (e.g., Fostering Knowledge Transfer in Disaster Preparedness/Risk Reduction within the Caribbean), a continent (e.g., Integrated Water Management in Africa) or a region at the sub-national level (e.g., Micro-Projects in Northwest Provinces of Cambodia)
• Thematic Trust Funds that address an issue globally (e.g., Climate Change, Poverty and Environment, HIV/AIDS)
Of the trust funds administered worldwide by UNDP, 58% are single country funds, 25% are geographic trust funds, and 17% are thematic trust funds (Figure 6). UNDP has worked closely with governments, national and sub-national government bodies, inter-ministerial groups and other stakeholders to support the funds to ensure that the funds provide a flexible, coordinated system for delivering results. UNDP's partner network is extensive, working alongside UN agencies, development banks, the private sector and civil society organizations, and draws from a wide breadth of donors by partnering with countries, foundations and the private sector.
UNDP supports trust funds as a valuable tool to facilitate south-south cooperation. Lessons learned from one trust fund can be applied to the others; UNDP works to ensure that experiences are exchanged between and among countries. Knowledge sharing and policy dialogues assist in the development and delivery of programming, and are key components of UNDP's work in administering trust funds.























3.2 UN Multi-Donor Trust Funds
 UNDP’s portfolio includes over $5 billion in more than 45 country-level and global MDTFs and over 25 Joint Programmes (JPs), administered through a specialized unit UNDP Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) Office. MDTFs and JPs are important tools to support specific country and/or global level strategic priorities that may be defined in national plans, UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs), and “Delivering as One” Frameworks. These funds support country-driven and UN-supported work in more than 80 countries with contributions from over 60 donors and development partners. They support a wide range of objectives, ranging from transition and reconstruction actions to development and environmental issues.
MDTFs and JPs are UN-based funds that respond to the needs on the ground, as defined by the relevant government partners and the UN Country Team. Once a fund is established, it enables the UN system to quickly deploy the technical, operational and administrative capacities of the UN and the expeditious approval and implementation of projects and programmes. MDTFs are established according to the guidance provided in the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) Guidance Note on Establishing, Managing and Closing Multi-Donor Trust Funds and generally relies on UN entities to implement projects and programmes.
















The MDTFs are governed through MDTF Steering Committees, which at the country level are normally co-chaired by the Resident Coordinator and national government, and include participating UN organizations and often donors and other stakeholders. One example, the UNDG Iraq Trust Fund, has received over $1.4 billion in contributions from 26 donors, including both developed and developing countries. It has supported 212 projects since 2004 and delivered results through 16 implementers in eight thematic sectors. Another type of fund, the MDG Achievement Fund, includes $700 million that is delivered in more than 50 countries.
Though differing in size and structure, each of the funds supports national ownership and capacity building. Further, UNDP supports the UN and other partners by providing fund management services that enhance the coherence, effectiveness and efficiency of the UN system. By providing a transparent and accountable framework for MDTFs, UNDP promotes coordination across UN agencies toward the efficient delivery of results.
Importantly, UNDP also has the systems in place to help countries manage trust funds as they evolve and grow. For example, the global UN-REDD Programme Fund helps developing countries to build capacity to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The programme started in 2008 with $12 million from a single donor. Only four years later, it had expanded to a $97 million fund funded by four donors. UNDP was able to help the fund navigate this dramatic growth by managing contributions and leveraging initial funds to attract increased investment.
For MRV of funds, UNDP provides support through a web-based reporting portal that offers full public disclosure and visibility to all partners. Information relating to donor contributions, transfers and expenditures, approved projects and activities, external reviews and evaluations, official notices and publications are all housed in one accessible location in a full range of information formats. This information documents where, to whom and how much funding has been contributed globally to MDTFs, and tracks the related activities implemented and results achieved. In keeping with UNDP's commitment to transparency, this information is displayed on the MPTF Office GATEWAY in real time directly from UNDP's accounting system (see Figure 7).


UNDP is an implementing agency of some of the largest global environmental trust funds in the world, including the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund, Multilateral Fund, Special Climate Change Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund and Adaptation Fund, The organization currently supports the implementation of an $8 billion portfolio of 1,000 climate change and ecosystems-management projects. As an implementing agency, UNDP provides technical and financial assistance for projects across all thematic areas — including mitigation, adaptation, technology, finance and REDD — and helps countries to put in place the systems that bolster low-emission, climate-resilient develop ment
UNDP also provides support for the implementation of projects under a variety of bilateral funds. For example, under the $92 million Africa Adaptation Programme, UNDP supports 20 countries to develop integrated and comprehensive climate change adaptation actions and resilience plans. The programme ensures that national development processes weigh climate change risks and opportunities in order to secure development gains, UNDP helps countries establish an enabling environment and develop the capacity required to design, finance, implement and monitor long-term and cost-effective adaptation policies and plans.


3.4 ( UNDP National Climate Fund Advisory Services
Leveraging UNDP's experience as a trust fund manager and implementation service provider for global, regional, national and thematic trust funds, UNDP provides advisory services to governments to establish and operate national environment and climate change funds. UNDP's advisory services include support for:
• NCF Design
• Capitalization
• Trustee or Administrative Agent
• Capacity Development
• Implementation
NCF Design — UNDP supports countries to develop and codify operational guidance to ensure streamlined fund delivery. Using the multi-stakeholder approach of Chapter 2, UNDP helps countries to develop detailed term sheets that consolidate the decisions emerging from the design process. In this way, the funds can provide flexible, coordinated and predictable funding toward the achievement of national sustainable development priorities.
Designing funds according to a country's priorities and circumstances is central to UNDP's approach. The objectives of a fund, for example, should align with national goals on climate change, any short-, medium- and long-term climate and development plans, capacities to manage and deliver climate finance and other political and economic considerations. In cases where countries do not have an existing strategy on climate change, or the existing strategy is outdated, UNDP has the tools and guidelines to help countries develop comprehensive strategic and programmatic roadmaps to achieve sustainable low-emission, climate-resilient development.
Ensuring that all relevant stakeholders participate in the design process is an important element of any national fund. UNDP's term sheet approach consolidates stakeholder inputs so that a national fund addresses country-driven priorities as efficiently and effectively as possible. While the questions posed in a term sheet are universal — objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary arrangements, implementing arrangements and MRV — UNDP works to ensure that the answers reflect unique country priorities and circumstances.
UNDP has established teams of technical advisers at the national, regional and global level, as well as administrative and trustee units, to support countries throughout project design and delivery. For more detail on UNDP's support team, please see www.undp.org/climatechange.

Capitalization — Mobilizing resources is a critical part of any national fund. UNDP assists countries with establishing regulatory frameworks for identifying and collecting resources. This includes public, private, multilateral and bilateral sources of finance.
From UNDP's experience, it is imperative that climate finance be used catalytically, leveraging accessible funding sources to spur additional investments in climate change projects. The finance required to support action on climate change is immense and an NCF should be able to collect and blend multiple sources together for maximum benefit. For example, an NCF can use public funds to create enabling investment environments and remove barriers for domestic and foreign investment. In this way, public funds cannot only be leveraged to attract private investment in projects, but the NCF lays the foundation for private investment in the longer term.
UNDP has a number of facilities, tools and platforms to help countries put capitalization systems in place to attract and manage new sources of finance. One programme, the MDG Carbon Facility, works together with commercial banks to provide the private sector in developing countries with a direct link to carbon markets. Another programme, Capacity Development for Decision-Makers to Address Climate Change, helps countries to conduct investment and financial flow analyses so they can get an accurate picture of what types of finance are needed to accomplish their climate change goals.
UNDP also assists countries as they consider using innovative sources of finance. Establishing a levy on specific industries, for example, can require a number of regulatory and financial frameworks. UNDP helps countries to explore these options.
Trustee or Administrative Agent — As a trustee/administrative agent, UNDP provides transparent and accountable fund management services to enhance coherence, effectiveness and efficiency. UNDP provides the full range of financial services, including receiving contributions from sources, administering funds received, disbursing funds to each implementing organization in accordance with the objectives and guidance of the fund, consolidating statements and reports and providing final reporting.
UNDP provides a ""one stop shop"" for all of the financial and legal activities of the NCF. Legal documents, such as partnership agree-
ments, memorandums of understanding and other agreements that codify partnerships and relationships with stakeholders, can be held by UNDP. Furthermore, contributors, governing bodies, implementers and recipients can find information on the collection, management and disbursement of funds from one unified source. This supports transparency, efficiency and accountability.


UNDP, when acting as the administrative agent/trustee, only disburses funds when directed by the governing bodies. The administrative agent/trustee does not make any funding or implementation decisions at anytime.
Capacity Development — As a capacity building organization, UNDP works to ensure that any national fund strengthens the capacity of governing bodies, implementers, recipients and other stakeholders, enhancing their ability to manage the operations of the fund and to support delivery of projects. This promotes a country's ownership and ensures that the operations of the fund fully align with national priorities.
This is especially important as countries engage with national implementation and ""direct access"" of climate finance. UNDP's services for NCFs strengthen national institutions' ability to collect, blend, coordinate and account for climate finance, helping them align with international fiduciary standards. Through NCFs, countries can build the national systems that better position them to manage climate change programming and meet the standards necessary for national implementation under the Adaptation Fund and other sources.
Implementation — As discussed above, UNDP also provides implementation services at the national, regional and global levels, and can support the implementation of NCF programmes in different capacities. Importantly, UNDP has systems in place to manage its role as an administrative agent/trustee alongside its role as an implementer of climate change projects. To avoid any real or perceived conflict of interest between its fund-management and programmatic roles, UNDP firewalls its administrative and implementing functions. This helps to keep the government in the driving seat and establish clear roles to support the efficient delivery of funds to achieve results on the ground.



Conclusion
Countries have immense opportunities to utilize climate finance — more sources of funding exist than ever before to help countries achieve their climate change objectives. However, in order for this increased funding to achieve real results, countries must be equipped to effectively access and channel funds toward their climate and development priorities. It is critical that the increased number of funding sources are matched with an increase in a country's ability to collect, blend, coordinate and account for climate finance.
As this guidebook demonstrates, National Climate Funds are a useful tool that can support countries to optimize their access to and management of climate finance. NCFs are nationally-owned and nationally- managed so that a country can collect the sources that are right for them, blend them together, impie ment activities in a manner that accomplishes their priorities and set up a nationally-relevant system to account for the results of their work. NCFs put countries in the driving seat for transforming their economies and achieving low-emission, climate-resilient development.
Based on UNDP's experience in the administration of over 750 trust funds at the national, global and regional levels, and 40 Multi-Donor Trust Funds around the world, there is a set of key decisions that a country must consider when designing and establishing an NCF:
• Defining the objectives
• Identifying capitalization
• Instilling effective governance
• Ensuring sound fiduciary management
• Supporting efficient implementation arrangements
• Facilitating effective monitoring, reporting and verification
Once key decisions have been made, a country will have crafted the components of its NCF; these components will provide a structure that helps to drive resources toward a country's climate and development priorities. A carefully considered and well-designed NCF will ensure that systems are in place to facilitate the flow of funds and monitoring, reporting and verification. Further, support and coordination should underscore all of an NCF's components, ensuring that efficient decision-making supports the implementation of projects and programmes that achieve the NCF's goals.
Importantly, NCFs are not one-size-fits-all. Each NCF must be tailored to country priorities and realities. They should be firmly rooted in, and aligned with, existing national strategies, frameworks, systems and other initiatives on climate change. NCFs must also define the fund's relationship to other global funds and programmes so that the NCF can make the best use of available resources and avoid duplicating other efforts.

In UNDP's experience, the use of a term sheet helps to define the design and operations of the NCF by capturing the key considerations of each of its components. As a document that outlines critical pieces of information about the operations and scope of the fund, a term sheet supports an efficient, transparent and robust NCF design. While the questions posed by a term sheet are universal, the answers will be unique to each country.
Stakeholder engagement is a critical part of the design and establishment of NCFs. Government, civil society, academia, the United Nations, development banks, the private sector and others can contribute specific and targeted inputs so that the NCF operates as efficiently as possible. Term sheets are also useful for this purpose — they can provide a structure for stakeholder engagement, ensuring that all voices are heard, and that roles, responsibilities and expectations are defined clearly.
Capacity development is also a key element of any NCF. The NCF should support on-going capacity development of governing bodies, implementers, the trustee and other stakeholders so that they can drive results and continue to build robust systems that address the country's climate change priorities over time. Capacity development is especially important as more global funds include opportunities for countries to access funds directly. Countries can use NCFs to strengthen national institutions and align with international fiduciary standards so that they can meet the criteria associated with those funds.
Throughout this guidebook, a number of existing NCFs have been featured. It is important to learn from their experiences and build on lessons from their NCF design and establishment process. A key lesson applicable to all countries designing an NCF is to be very clear about what the NCF should accomplish. Countries must realistically assess their needs: in some cases the NCF should be very broad and attract many different types of funding sources; in others, a more targeted NCF is necessary to focus on a key priority for the country. The targeted NCF can be capitalized by a limited number of funding sources in order to decrease administrative and operating costs.
NCFs help countries to manage climate finance and to achieve their sustainable development goals. By creating an NCF, a country sets in place a system that efficiently collects, blends, coordinates and accounts for climate finance, helping it to take advantage of the increased number of climate funding sources available. In this way, NCFs help countries to manage climate finance catalytically and build a system that supports low-emission and climate-resilient development now and in the future.





Glossary of Terms




Adaptation - Initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems to actual or expected climate change effects.
Adaptation Fund - The Adaptation Fund was established by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

Emissions trading - A market-based approach to achieving emissions reduction objectives. It allows those reducing GFIG emissions below their emission cap to use or trade the excess reductions to offset emissions at another source inside or outside the country.

Fiduciary management - Fiduciary management allows for the efficient movement and tracking of funds flowing to and from an NCF. This can include establishing fiduciary standards that apply to all monetary transactions.
 Fossil fuels - Carbon-based fuels from fossil hydrocarbon deposits, including coal, peat, oil and natural gas.
 Global Environment Facility (GEF) - Established in 1991, the GEF is a financial mechanism under the UNFCCC that provides grants to countries for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer and persistent organic pollutants.
 Green Climate Fund (GCF) - Established at COP 16 in Cancun, Mexico, the GCF joined the GEF as a financial mechanism under the UNFCCC. The GCF will support climate change projects, programmes and policies and other activities in developing countries using thematic funding windows. The exact design arrangements and structure of the GCF will be negotiated through a Transitional Committee with the goal of approving the modalities at COP 17 in 2011.
 Greenhouse gases - Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, the atmosphere and clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor (H20), carbon dioxide (C02), nitrous oxide (N20), methane (CH4) and ozone (03) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine- containing substances. These are dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Besides carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulfur hexafluoride, hydro fluorocarbons and per fluorocarbons.
 Governance of an NCF - Governance includes bodies, decision-making processes and oversight functions that facilitate efficient management of an NCF.
 Implementation - Implementation includes the processes and agents set in place to carry out NCF programmes and projects. This can include programmatic instruments (e.g., grants or loans), processes for selecting implementing entities and oversight and legal responsibilities.
 Innovative sources of climate finance - Innovative sources refers to a range of non-traditional mechanisms to raise new and additional funds for development and climate activities, such as taxes on transport or financial transaction. The term is also sometime used to define innovative public financial schemes such as public-private equity funds or government-sponsored loan guarantee funds to scale up development action.
Chapter 6: Annex






 Kyoto Protocol - The Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC was adopted at the Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in 1997 in Kyoto. It contains legally binding commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Annex B countries agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012.
The Kyoto Protocol came into force on 16 February 2005.
 Market barriers - In the context of climate change mitigation, market barriers are conditions that prevent or impede the diffusion of cost- effective technologies or practices that would mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
 Mitigation - Technological change and substitution that reduces resource inputs and emissions per unit of output.
 Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) - MRV refers to the ability to quantify the results of an activity or funding commitment and provide this information to others. The information can then be independently checked for accuracy and reliability.
 Montreal Protocol - The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was adopted in Montreal in 1987, and subsequently adjusted and amended in London (1990), Copenhagen (1992), Vienna (1995), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). It controls the consumption and production of chlorine-and bromine-containing chemicals that destroy stratospheric ozone, such as chlorofluorocarbons, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and many others.
 Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) - MDTFs are a type of NCF that is generally established to support specific country and/or global level strategic priorities that may be defined in national plans, UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs), ""Delivering as One"" Frameworks, etc. Generally, an MDTF relies on UN agencies for implementation services.
 Nationally-Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) - Established under the UNFCCC process, a NAMA refers to a set of policies and actions countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) - Under the UNFCCC process, NAPAs provide a process for Least Developed Countries to identify priority activities based on urgent and immediate needs to adapt to climate change. LDCs submit NAPAs to the UNFCCC and can receive funding to implement the priority activities identified.
 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) - While NAPA focus on urgent and immediate needs, a NAP targets medium and long-term adaptation needs. NAPs can be undertaken by all countries.

National Climate Fund (NCF) - An NCF is a mechanism that supports countries to direct finance toward climate change projects and programmes by facilitating the collection, blending, coordination of, and accounting for climate finance. NCFs provide a country-driven system that can support climate change goal setting and strategic programming, oversee climate change project approval and implementation, measure performance, offer policy assurance and financial control of climate change funds, and assist with partnership management.
National Implementing Entity (NIE) - Under the Adaptation Fund,
NIEs are the national legal entities that have been identified by the Adaptation Fund Board as meeting the fiduciary standards adopted by the Board and accredited as NIE. NIEs can access funds directly for implanting climate change projects.
Objectives of an NCF - Objectives are the strategic goals of an NCF.
This can include mitigation, adaptation, REDD, capacity building, technology or other programmatic priorities, as well as management priorities such as attracting private sector investment.
Private equity - Investors focus on later stage and more mature technology or projects, and generally expects to exit their investment and make their returns in a three to five-year timeframe.
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) - A government service or private business venture which is funded and operated through a partnership of government and one or more private sector companies. PPP involves a contract between a public sector authority and a private party, in which the private party provides a public service or project and assumes substantial financial, technical and operational risk in the project.
Resilience - Refers to three conditions that enable a social or ecological system to absorb change and not fundamentally fall apart. The conditions are: ability to self-organize, ability to buffer disturbance and capacity for learning and adapting.
Secretariat - A secretariat manages day-to-day operations of the NCF, including scheduling meetings, collecting documents and liaising with the Steering Committee, Technical Committee, Implementers and other agents.
Stakeholders - Those who have interests in a particular decision, either as individuals or as representatives of a group. This includes people who can influence a decision as well as those affected by it. Decision makers are also stakeholders.
Standards - Set of rules or codes mandating or defining product performance (e.g., grades, dimensions, characteristics, test methods and rules for use).
Steering Committee - A Steering Committee of an NCF makes decisions on the disbursal of funds and oversees the high-level activities, including policy and operational guidelines, strategic direction and reporting. This group is often made up of multiple government ministries, such as environment, planning and finance, and representatives from civil society, the United Nations, development banks, private sector or other partners.
Subsidy - Direct payment or a tax reduction issued by the government to a private party for implementing a practice the government wishes to encourage.
Sources of climate finance - A number of sources can contribute to an NCF, including public domestic finance, public multilateral finance, public bilateral finance, private sources and innovative sources.
Technical Committee - The Technical Committee supports the Steering Committee by providing substantive reviews of project proposals and making recommendations for which proposals should receive funding.
Term sheet - A term sheet is a non-binding financial agreement that describes each of the elements of an NCF. It provides a concise framework for the objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary management, implementation arrangements and MRV of an NCF so that the basic conditions under which the NCF will operate are clearly defined. While many NCF term sheets follow a similar structure, they can be tailored to accommodate NCF design elements that support national needs and priorities.
Trustee/Administrative Agent - the trustee of an NCF provides a number of important fund management services, including receiving and holding contributions from various sources, disbursing funds to each participating entity on behalf of the steering committee (or other decision-making body) and providing financial reporting. Often, the trustee coordinates the legal contracts and agreements that underpin the transactions of funds. It ensures that the NCF meets all legal and fiduciary standards for collecting and distributing funds.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC; Convention) - The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and the European Economic Community. Its ultimate objective is the 'stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system/ It contains commitments for all parties. Under the Convention, parties included in Annex I aimed to return greenhouse gas emission not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
Vulnerability - The degree to which an individual, group or system is susceptible to harm due to hazards or stress, and its (in)ability to cope, recover or fundamentally adapt (become a new system or become extinct).

The GEO-4 assessment process

Since 1997, UNEP has produced Global Environment Outlook (GEO) reports providing assessments of the interactions between environment and society. With its core mandate of ""keeping the global environment under review/' UNEP coordinated a series of scientific assessments that included extensive consultations and participatory processes, resulting in the production of GEO reports in 1997, 1999 and 2002.
The fourth assessment, Global Environment Outlook: environment for development {GEO-4), is the most comprehensive GEO process to date. It was designed to ensure synergy between science and policy, while maintaining its scientific credibility and making it responsive to policy needs and objectives. The launch in 2007 of the GEO-4 report coincides with the 20th anniversary of the launch of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future.
GEO-4 uses it as a reference to assess progress in addressing key environment and development issues.
GEO-4 highlights the vital role of the environment in development and, more importantly, for human well-being.
GEO-4 is more than a report: it is also a comprehensive consultative process which began in 2004. In February of that year, an intergovernmental consultation on strengthening the scientific base of UNEP, which involved more than 100 governments and 50 partner organizations, called for a further strengthening of the GEO process. The global consultation was followed by regional consultations in September-October 2004, which identified key regional and global environmental issues. Building on these consultations, the scope, objectives and process of the GEO-4 were finalized and adopted by the First Global Intergovernmental and Multistakeholder Consultation in February 2005.
The assessment was carried out by 10 chapter expert groups consisting of coordinating lead authors and lead authors
supported by chapter coordinators provided by the UNEP secretariat. The draft outputs from the expert groups were subjected to an additional round of regional consultations and two rounds of extensive expert and government peer review. The review process was overseen by chapter review

editors. The assessment was also guided and supported by a High-level Consultative Group of senior government policy-makers, funding partners, scientists and academics as well as representatives of some UN agencies, international organizations, the private sector, GEO collaborating centres and civil society.
In 10 chapters, the GEO-4 assessment provides: an overview of environmental issues; state-and-trends of the environment between 1987 and 2007; human dimensions of environmental change; an outlook for the future using four scenarios; and the policy options available to sustain our common future:
Chapter 1 :	Environment	for	Development
Chapter 2:	Atmosphere
Chapter 3:	Land
Chapter 4:	Water
Chapter 5:	Biodiversity
Chapter 6:	Sustaining a	Common	Future
Chapter 7: Vulnerability of People and the Environment: Challenges and Opportunities Chapter 8: Interlinkages: Governance for Sustainability Chapter 9: The Future Today
Chapter 10: From the Periphery to the Core of Decision Making - Options for Action
The Summary for Decision Makers (SDM) was prepared by UNEP with technical inputs from the coordinating lead authors and inputs from the members of the High-level Consultative Group. It underwent two rounds of extensive expert and government peer review. Finally, the SDM was subject to in-depth consideration by the Second Global Intergovernmental and Multistakeholder Consultation in September 2007. The consultation adopted a statement which endorsed the SDM.
The basis for this Summary for Decision Makers can be found in the GEO-4 chapters. Reference sources for graphics used in this report are provided at the end of the report.



KEY MESSAGES FOR DECISION MAKERS
 Humankind depends on the environment, which is critical for both development and human well-being. Natural resources - compared to financial, material and human resources - are the foundation for much of the wealth of countries. Environmental change can affect peoples security, health, social relations and material needs.


There is evidence of unprecedented environmental
change at global and regional levels:
■ The Earth's surface is warming. This is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level. Other major impacts, include changes in water availability, land degradation, food security, and loss
of biodiversity. The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heat waves, storms, floods and droughts would dramatically affect many millions of people including those in small island states and Polar regions. While in the past century the global average temperature increased by 0.74°C, the best estimate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for additional warming over the current century is projected to be from 1.8 to 4.0°C. Climate change may further exacerbate the loss of biodiversity and degradation of land, soil, forest, freshwater and oceans.
■ More than 2 million people globally die prematurely every year due to outdoor and indoor air pollution. Although air pollution has decreased in some cities due to technological and policy measures, increasing emissions
in other cities are intensifying the challenges. Indoor air pollution due to the improper burning of solid biomass fuels imposes an enormous health burden.
■ The ""hole"" in the stratospheric ozone layer over the Antarctic - the layer that protects people from harmful ultraviolet radiation
- is now the largest it has ever been. Due to decreased emissions of ozone depleting substances and assuming full Montreal Protocol compliance, the ozone layer is expected to recover, but not until between 2060 and 2075 as a result of long lag times.
■ Unsustainable land use and climate change are driving land degradation, including soil erosion, nutrient depletion, water scarcity,salinity, desertification, and the disruption of biological cycles. Poor people suffer disproportionately from the effects of land degradation, especially in the drylands, which support some 2 billion people, 90 per cent of whom live in developing countries.
■ The per capita availability of freshwater is declining globally, and contaminated water remains the greatest single environmental cause of human sickness and death. If present trends continue, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025, and two-thirds of the people in the world could be subject to water stress. The decline of quantity and quality of surface and groundwater is impacting aquatic ecosystems and their services.
■ Aquatic ecosystems continue to be heavily exploited, putting at risk sustainability of food supplies and biodiversity. Global marine and freshwater fish catches show large-scale declines, caused mostly by persistent overfishing.
■ The great majority of well-studied species are declining in distribution, abundance or both. Although the decline in the area of temperate forest has been reversed, with an annual increase of 30 000 km2 between 1990 and 2005, deforestation in the tropics continued
at an annual rate of 1 30 000 km2 during the same period. More than 16 000 species have been identified as threatened with extinction.
These unprecedented changes are due to human activities in an increasingly globalized, industrialized and interconnected world, driven by expanding flows of goods, services, capital, people, technologies, information, ideas and labour, even affecting isolated populations. The responsibility for global environmental pressures is not equally distributed throughout the world. For instance, in 2004, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Annex 1 countries with 20 per cent of world population produced 57 per cent of gross world product based on purchasing power parity and accounted for 46 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial development, natural resource extraction and carbon-intensive industrial production, may have significant environmental consequences, which need to be addressed. Responses include the use of the best available technologies and practices as appropriate.
Environmental change affects human development options, with poor people being the most vulnerable. For example, in the period between 1992 and 2001, floods were the most frequent natural disaster, killing nearly 100 000 people and affecting more than 1.2 billion people. More than 90 per cent of the people exposed to disasters live in the developing world.
Biophysical and social systems can reach tipping points, beyond which there are abrupt, accelerating, or potentially irreversible changes.
The four GEO-4 scenarios show an increasing risk of crossing tipping points, even as some global environmental degradation trends are slowed or reversed at different rates towards the middle of the century. Changes in biophysical and social systems may continue even if the forces of change are removed, as evidenced in the stratospheric ozone depletion and the loss of species.
The transition towards sustainable development needs to be pursued more intensively by nations and the international community, including through capacity building and technological support to developing countries. Actions to reduce the drivers of environmental change by all stakeholders, including the private sector and consumers, require trade-offs, which may involve hard choices, among different values and concerns.
Decision-makers can promote timely action by integrating prevention, mitigation and adaptation efforts into the core of decision-making through sustained efforts which include:
■ Reducing people's vulnerability to
environmental and socio-economic changes by decentralization, strengthening resource rights of local people, improving access to financial and technical support, improving capacities to cope with natural disasters, and empowering women and vulnerable groups;
■ 
Integrating environmental activities into the broader development framework, including by ascertaining the environmental impacts of proposed public spending, identifying sectoral and inter-sectoral environmental targets, promoting best practices, and monitoring longterm achievements;
■ Enhancing treaty compliance by overcoming administrative costs and the heavy reporting burden of Parties, improving monitoring and compliance, and enhancing coordination, particularly at national level;
■ Creating enabling environments for innovations and emerging solutions by using economic instruments, new and existing technologies, empowerment of stakeholders, and more adaptive approaches which break away from the traditional segmented institutional management and production systems, and result in more sustainable consumption and production patterns;
■ Strengthening environmental knowledge, education and awareness by making the best-available scientific research and data accessible through improved monitoring, assessments and knowledge infrastructure, building on the rapid developments in information and communication technologies;
■ Mobilizing financial resources to address environmental problems through innovative approaches, including payments for ecosystem services while achieving an open, non- discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system as well as meaningful trade liberalization benefiting countries at all stages of development.
Knowledge on the interlinkages between environment and development, and the impacts on human well-being, gained since the release of Our Common Future, the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, can be used effectively for the transition towards sustainable development. Concerns about the global environment may have reached a tipping point of their own, with the growing realization that, for many problems, the benefits of early action outweigh the costs. Now is the time to pursue the transition towards sustainable development supported by well-governed, innovative and results-oriented institutions.


	INTRODUCTION

       In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) presented its report, Our Common Future. The Brundtland Commission, as it was known, brought international attention to the concept of sustainable development - a challenge to meet today's development needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Twenty years on, the challenges as set out in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are even more profound, and the importance of the environment in sustaining development is becoming ever clearer.

	ENVIRONMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT
       Development depends on the environment while its impacts on the environment affect human well-being. The world has changed radically over the past two decades. Significant changes to geopolitical borders have occurred. Global population has grown from 5 billion to 6.7 billion. There has been a net annual rise in gross domestic product (GDP) per person of almost 2 per cent and continued increases in trade volume, CO2 emissions and agricultural land (see Figure 1). Technological innovations have improved livelihoods and health. Low transportation costs, coupled with market liberalization and the rapid development of telecommunications have fuelled globalization and altered trade patterns, expanding the flow of goods, services, capital, people, technologies, information, ideas and labour. While millions have worked their way out of poverty and have access to improved services, such as healthcare, there are still more than 1 billion poor people in the world. They lack essential services such as clean water, adequate nutrition, shelter and clean energy, making them especially vulnerable to environmental and socio-economic changes.



The responsibility for the mounting global environmental pressures is not equally distributed throughout the world. For instance, in 2004, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Annex 1 countries with 20 per cent of world population, produced 57 per cent of gross world product based on purchasing power parity and accounted for 46 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Changing drivers and pressures, including the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas, the widening gap between the richest and the poorest, and growth in demand for energy, among other factors, have led to a deepening disparity in consumption patterns and in outsourcing of environmentally damaging production processes.
Long term sustainable development aimed at improving human well-being entails:
■ increasing the asset base and its productivity;
■ empowering poor people and marginalized communities;
■ reducing and managing risks; and
■ taking a long-term perspective with regard to intra- and inter-generational equity.
Ecosystems provide the natural resources capital needed for development. Natural resources, account for more than a quarter of the wealth of low-income countries and somewhat less in higher income countries. Changes in ecosystem services can affect natural resources as well as financial, material, and human assets. All people - rich and poor, urban and rural - rely on natural resources through a complex web of interactions. The GEO conceptual framework (see back page) illustrates many of the links between environmental change and peoples security, health, social relations and material needs, all of which are components of human well-being. Sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism and mining are instrumental in utilizing natural resources and ecosystem services.



 The normative framework for human development is reflected in the internationally agreed development goals in the Millennium Declaration. Environmental sustainability is one of the development goals critical to achieving the other targets. The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, for example, is dependent on sustainable agriculture which, in turn, relies on soils, water and ecological processes.
 Increasingly, there is evidence that investment in environmental management results in increased income generation for the rural poor It can also result in income generation for industries in developed countries

that produce environmental remediation equipment; for example, the environmental industry is Denmark's second largest export.
It is estimated that 80 per cent of people in developing countries rely on traditional medicines, and mote than half of the most frequently prescribed drugs in developed countries derive from natural resources. Worldwide, moie than 1.3 billion people depend on fisheries, forests and agriculture for employment. Communities in resource dependent countries are, therefore, especially vulnerable to environmental degradation, climate change, and the loss of services from ecosystems. In the Adagon watershed in India, for example, the
annual days of employment rose from 75 to 200 after ecosystem restoration was undertaken. Traditional management in Fiji to promote recovery of fisheries through a no-take area in a marine coastal zone resulted in a 35-43 per cent increase in income over three years.
Knowledge about the value of ecosystem services and the role of environment in supporting development has improved over the last two decades. A further enhancement of such knowledge can facilitate the transition to sustainable development. This transition will require trade-offs, and hard choices, among different values and concerns in society.

	ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Changes in the Earths environment
We now have evidence of unprecedented environmental changes at global and regional levels. These unprecedented changes are due to human activities in an increasingly globalized, industrialized and interconnected world, driven by expanding flows of goods, services, capital, people, technologies, information, ideas and labour, even affecting isolated populations. The key changes and associated challenges and opportunities are presented below.
Atmosphere
Atmospheric changes have major implications for human well-being. Since Our Common Future considered the topic of climate change, there has been a sharp and continuing rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere. Climate change (including global warming) is under way, and an average temperature increase of 0.74°C over the past century has been recorded. This trend, in which 1 1 of the last 1 2 years (1 995-2006) rank among the 1 2 warmest years since 1 850, is virtually certain. Impacts are already evident and include changes in water availability, spread of waterborne disease vectors, food security, sea-level and ice cover as exemplified by melting of the Greenland ice sheet (see Figure 2). Anthropogenic GFHG emissions (principally carbon dioxide, CO2) are the main drivers of change. The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts would dramatically affect many millions of people. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects an increase in the global temperature of 1.8–4°C by the end of this century. This will lead to potentially massive consequences, especially for the most vulnerable, poor and disadvantaged people who contribute to climate change to a lesser extent. Even if atmospheric concentrations of GHGs were to be stabilized today, land and ocean temperatures would increase for decades and sea levels would rise for centuries.
Adaptation to climate change is necessary
even if major mitigation measures are rapidly implemented. The array of potential adaptive responses available to human societies is very large, ranging from purely technological (such
as sea defences), through behavioural (such
as altered food and recreational choices) to managerial (such as modified farm practices), and policy (such as planning regulations). However, there are formidable barriers to adaptation. For developing countries, availability of resources and building adaptive capacity are particularly important.
Mitigation and adaptation to climate change can be integrated into development policies
by pursuing innovative and emerging solutions, which will also create new opportunities and jobs. The use of economic policy instruments and public and private sector investments in new technologies, clean and renewable energy, energy efficiency, nuclear energy and carbon sequestration are some of the many options already being used.
More than 2 million people are estimated to
die prematurely each year due to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Severe indoor air pollution occurs in many poor communities when biomass and coal are used for cooking and heating in enclosed places without adequate ventilation. Outdoor air pollution (see Figure 3) arises from many sources, including industrial processes, motor vehicles, energy generation, and wildfires. Although air quality has improved dramatically in some cities, many areas still suffer from excessive air pollution, resulting in severe health impacts.

Long-range transport of a variety of air pollutants also remains an issue of concern for human and ecosystem health.
The “hole” in the stratospheric ozone layer over the Antarctic – the layer that protects people from harmful ultraviolet radiation – is now the largest it has ever been. Due to decreased emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODS), the ozone layer is expected to recover, assuming full Montreal Protocol compliance, but not until between 2060 and 2075 as a result of long lag times. Early precautionary action on stratospheric ozone depletion was taken before the impacts were fully evident.
In 1987, the international community, through cooperation among developing and developed countries, agreed to phase out production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons and other ODS, through the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. These substances ha\e undergone a massive phaseout over the past 20 years. Consequently, by 2004 the emissions of OD$ are about 20 per cent of their 1990 level. As ODS were also GHGs, the treaty has simultaneously contributed to mitigating climate change. The protocol represents a global success story brought about, among others, by use of economic incentives, increased private investments, and enhanced public awareness.
Land
Unsustainable land and water use, and the impacts of climate change are driving land degradation, including soil erosion, nutrient depletion, water scarcity, salinity, chemical contamination and disruption of biological cycles. The cumulative effects of these changes threaten food security, biodiversity, and carbon fixation and storage. Poor people suffer disproportionately from the effects of land degradation, especially in the drylands, which support some two billion people, 90 per cent of whom live in developing countries.
One example of long-term success in combating land degradation is in the Great Plains of the United States, where a comprehensive package of measures was first introduced in the 1930s. As a result, natural, social, institutional and financial capital has been rebuilt and maintained to the present day. The Land Care programme in Australia is another successful example. In Africa and other developing regions, many countries have embarked on national action programmes to combat desertification within the framework cf the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).

The decline in the area of temperate forest

has been reversed with an average annual increase of 30 000 km2 between 1990 and 2005. However, deforestation in the tropics has continued at an average annual rate of 130 000 km2, with serious implications for GHG gas concentrations and biodiversity loss. Declines in natural forest area are partially countered by ecological restoration efforts, investment in planted forests, and more efficient use of wood products. More forest is being designated for ecosystem services but effective management is required to maintain and restore ecosystems.

The release of harmful and persistent pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic chemicals, from mining, manufacturing, sewage, energy and transport emissions, the use of agro- chemicals, and from leaking stockpiles of obsolete chemicals and products, remains a problem for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although there has been progress in dealing with pollution in the industrialized countries, mainly through regulation, achieving an acceptable level of safety worldwide requires strengthening of institutional and technical capacities in all countries.

 The average population density in coastal areas is now twice as high as the global average. More than 100 million people live in areas no more than one metre above mean sea-level (see Figure 4); 21 of the worlds 33 mega-cities are located in coastal areas, with most of them in developing countries. Poor planning and the loss of key ecosystems such as wetlands, mangroves and coral reefs, and sea level rise due to climate change, are increasing the risk of flooding and reducing coastal protection from storms, tsunamis and erosion.
Water
 Contaminated water remains the greatest cause of human sickness and death on a global scale. The per capita availability of freshwater is declining, in part because of excessive withdrawals of surface and groundwater. If present trends continue, many countries will not meet their MDGs relating to water. About 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025 and two-thirds of the people in the world could be subject to water stress, with the GEO-4 scenarios indicating that there could be more than 5.1 billion people living under such conditions in 2050.
 Since agriculture accounts for more than 70 per cent of global water-use, it is a logical target for conservation management. Development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has enhanced many aspects of human well-being and ecosystem health, through improved water availability and quality both in catchments and in their respective coastal zones.
The worlds oceans are the primary regulator of global climate and an important sink for GHGs (see Figure 5), leading, for example, to ocean acidification. At watershed, regional and ocean basin scales, the water cycle is being affected by long-term changes in climate, altering precipitation patterns. Climate changes are also causing major reductions in Arctic sea ice cover, and the accelerated melting of permafrost and mountain glaciers, and Arctic land ice. These in turn have serious impacts on the security of communities in the Arctic, in glacier-fed river basins and deltas, and in low-lying coastal areas, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) worldwide. Concerted global actions are needed to address the root causes, while local efforts can reduce human vulnerability.
Eutrophication of inland and coastal waters caused by excessive nutrient loads from sources such as agricultural fertilizer causes sporadic major fish kills, and threatens human health and livelihoods. The deterioration of inland and coastal water quality is being exacerbated by other pollutants from land-based sources, particularly, municipal wastewater, and urban run-off.
Aquatic ecosystems continue to be heavily exploited, putting at risk sustainability of food supplies and biodiversity. Global marine and freshwater fish catches show large- scale declines, caused mostly by persistent overfishing. Total marine catches are being sustained only by fishing ever further offshore and deeper in the oceans and progressively lower down the food chain. Freshwater stocks suffer from habitat degradation and altered thermal regimes related to climate change and water impoundment.
Biodiversity
Biodiversity decline and loss of ecosystem services continue to be a major global threat to future development. The reduction in distribution and functioning of land, freshwater and marine biodiversity is more rapid than at any time in human history. Ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and drylands are being transformed and, in some cases, irreversibly degraded.

Rates of species extinction are increasing.
The great majority of well-studied species, including commercially important fish stocks, are declining in distribution or abundance or both. Genetic diversity of agricultural and other species is widely considered to be in decline.
Despite the importance of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, they are being modified in extent and composition by people at an unprecedented rate, with little understanding of the implications this will have in terms of their ability to function and provide services in the future. Figure 6 highlights the status of terrestrial ecosystems.
Biodiversity plays multiple roles in the daily lives of people through the supply of ecosystem services. In agriculture, biodiversity contributes to regulating and supporting services through soil formation, nutrient cycling, and pollination. Biodiversity is the basis for cultural services through spiritual and aesthetic benefits, and amenity values from ecotourism. Some economic estimates are available, for example, the value of the regulating services provided by honeybees as pollinators for crops has been estimated at well over US$2 billion per year, and the annual world fish catch is valued at US$58 billion.
In recognition of the importance of biodiversity and the fact that poor people in rural and remote areas tend to be the most directly affected by
the deterioration or loss of ecosystem services, many governments have established and adopted the 2010 biodiversity target to reduce the rate
of loss of biodiversity at global, regional and national scales. The target was adopted by
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),
and endorsed by the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD).
There have been local success stories with the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, particularly where economic incentives have been made available, such as for ecotourism, biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices, certification schemes and various initiatives on payments for ecosystem services. However,
at a global level, and in most regions of the world, biodiversity continues to be lost because current policies and economic systems do not incorporate the values of biodiversity effectively in either the political or the market systems, and many policies that are already in place are yet to be fully implemented.


4 Regional perspectives
The UNEP regions share common concerns about a number
of critical environmental and sustainability issues, yet face tremendous differences in their challenges. Strong interdependencies exist and are reinforced by globalization and trade, with growing demand on resources in and across the regions.
Significant improvements in human well- being have been achieved globally over the last 20 years. However, there are still more than 1 billion poor people who lack essential services and who are not buffered against environmental and socio-economic changes. Many countries will not meet the 2015 targets of the MDGs. Addressing vulnerability provides opportunities to meet these goals.

Throughout the world, recurring patterns of vulnerability can be found, including in industrialized and developing regions, and urban and rural areas. Examples of these include contaminated sites, drylands, energy security and, urbanization in coastal zones. The most vulnerable groups include the poor, indigenous populations, women and children in both developed and developing countries. Analysis of representative patterns of vulnerability in different regions shows the unequal distribution of risks for specific groups of people. Although vulnerability is contextes and-site-specific, certain common elements can be observed across regions, scales and contexts. Table 1 lists the environmental issues which were identified by regional consultations in September-October 2004.

The following sections highlight environmental challenges and opportunities of the regions.
Africa's land is under pressure from a growing population, natural disasters such as drought and floods, desertification, the inappropriate use of technology and chemicals, and poverty. In addition to threatening the livelihoods of the rural poor, land degradation has widespread effects on Africa's river catchments, forests and agricultural land, and ecosystem services. Per capita access to land is declining even as the region struggles to increase food production per unit area. Per capita agricultural production declined by 0.4 per cent between 2000 and 2004. Climate change and more frequent droughts and floods in Africa, are exacerbating land degradation. Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change and has the least adaptive capacity. Water and sanitation are also priority issues for most African countries. Despite an overall improvement in the coverage of water supply between 1 990 and 2002, the regional projection to 2015 still falls below the MDG target of 75 per cent coverage.
The region continues to be at risk from hazardous and electronic waste dumping due to inadequate monitoring capacities and institutional mechanisms to manage such waste. Africa holds at least 50 000 tonnes of obsolete pesticides which threaten both people and the environment. Lack of environmentally friendly technology is a major problem in Africa that should be dealt with through technology transfers, taking into consideration the preservation of cultural heritage. Although there are efforts to manage the environment through the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), initiatives such as the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) environment action plan, land and agrarian reforms, and integrated land and water management programmes, policy shortcomings still exist, and so do unfair agricultural subsidies in developed regions which undermine the profitability of farming and livelihoods of small landholders in Africa.
In Asia and the Pacific, environmental change is driven by rapid population growth, changing consumption patterns accompanying higher incomes, and burgeoning industrial and urban development. Various factors have led to an increase in urban air pollution: a highly urbanized population; poorly planned municipal development and transport services; a 2.5 times increase in the use of passenger cars over the last two decades (see Figure 7); and haze pollution from forest fires and peri-urban industries in Southeast Asia. Air pollution causes the premature deaths of about 500 000 people annually. Many countries have, in recent years, initiated a switch from conventional fossil fuels to cleaner renewable forms of energy. Excessive and inefficient use of water, industrial pollution, climatic variability and natural disasters ate major causes of water stress. Although there has been remarkable progress in the provision of improved drinking water over the last decade, some 655 million people in the region (1 7.6 percent) still lack access to safe water
The population pressure on marginal land and climate-re feted extremes in the past few decades pose a risk to terrestrial and marine biodiversity in the region. Rapid changes in consumption patterns have fed
to the generation of large quantities of electric and electronic waste, and toxic and hazardous waste. The illegal traffic in these wastes poses new, growing challenges. Although most countries have developed extensive domestic laws, regulations and standards related to the environment and participate in global action through multilateral and bilateral agreements, the challenging task is to implement those laws and regulations. Rapid introduction of innovative and energy efficient technology should improve environmental conditions in the region.

Europe is a region of great environmental and socio-economic diversity. Economic recovery in the past two decades has resulted in an increase of national income in many countries across the region. This, together with the growing number of individual households, is driving environmental change. The region has made progress in decoupling economic growth from resource use, although per capita household consumption is steadily increasing. Recently, growing public awareness underpinned by rising prices, has given new political momentum to climate change policies. Since 1987, GHG emissions (see Figure 8) from the energy sector have been reduced in some countries in Western Europe, although they have increased across the region as a whole. Emissions of air pollutants are largely driven by the demand for greater mobility, including increasing use of private transport and deterioration of public transport systems in many countries.
Despite much progress, poor water and urban air quality still cause substantial problems in some parts of Eastern and Southern Europe. Intensification and land abandonment are the two major trends in agriculture having impacts on biodiversity, as well as increasing the risk of land degradation and desertification, especially in southern parts of the region. Transport infrastructure is fragmenting landscapes and reducing biodiversity.
With its many action plans, environmental institutions and legal instruments, the region has extensive experience with environmental cooperation. Easier to manage environmental problems (e.g., point-source air and water pollution) have been effectively addressed in much of Central and Western Europe, but remain challenges in many Eastern European countries. The use of market-based instruments in environmental policy has gained ground substantially in Europe, especially in the area of taxes, charges and tradeable permits. Comprehensive systems of pollution charges for air and water are being implemented and resource use and waste taxes are being introduced. More efficient production and consumption patterns need to be established, and good governance mechanisms and lessons learned exchanged within the region, to achieve sustainable development.
The Latin America and the Caribbean region is the most urbanized in the developing world, with 77 per cent of the total population living in cities, and urbanization rates are still increasing. The challenge for developing and implementing urban environmental policies is, therefore, considerable. There has been relative success in improving the quality of fuels, public transport systems (Bogota, Colombia, and Curitiba, Brazil), air quality management (major Mexican cities), water law reforms (Chile), and community-based solid waste management schemes. Nevertheless, urban air pollution is high and increasing in smaller cities, untreated and domestic and industrial waste and waters are a growing problem, and domestic waste is generally not treated, contributing to water pollution.

The rich biodiversity in the region is threatened by forest conversion to pastures, infrastructure and urban areas. These threats are contributing to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as the loss of indigenous cultures and knowledge. Land degradation, resulting from deforestation, overgrazing and inappropriate irrigation is affecting 15.7 per cent of the region. Integrated prevention and control programmes are helping to decrease annual deforestation rates in some areas, and protected areas have almost doubled over the last two decades now covering 10.5 per cent of the land base. New efforts are being made to conserve terrestrial and marine corridors, such as the Meso-American Biological Corridor and those in the Amazon.
Although Latin America is responsible for only 5 per cent of the global GHG emissions and represents 8 per cent of the total world population, climate change is projected to significantly affect the region. The impacts include rising sea levels, more hurricanes and storms (see Figure 9), more pronounced droughts and floods associated with El Nino events, decline in water supplies stored in glaciers and declines in crop and livestock productivity. Particularly vulnerable are tropical rain forests, mangroves and coral reefs, mountain ecosystems, coastal wetlands and SIDS. Extreme climatic events have increased over the past 20 years.
The development of national climate change strategies is critical in this regard. Declining water quality, climate change and algal blooms have contributed to the rise in water-borne diseases in some coastal regions.
 
Most successful responses to environmental issues in the region have involved command- and-control measures. However, emerging policies have combined these approaches with economic instruments (including application of the polluter-pays-principle). Payments for ecosystem services are being implemented in several countries (such as Costa Rica, Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico) to protect biodiversity.
The use of economic instruments and effective compliance with environmental law need coupling with participatory and ecologically oriented urban planning as the strategic basis for sustainability.

In North America, the multi-stakeholder process identified energy and climate change, freshwater stress, and sprawl as major environmental issues facing the region. North Americas growing economy and population contribute to the ongoing environmental challenges. The region is a leader in research in environmental science and reporting, integrating the public into environmental decision making, providing timely access to information on environmental conditions, and the production of goods-and-services that mitigate or prevent environmental damage. A solid foundation of legislation from the 1970s, and newer innovative market-based programmes and modes for paying for ecosystem services, provide incentives for controlling pollution and conserving natural resources. Canada has signed the Kyoto Protocol and produced a plan to become more energy-efficient.
As a measure of progress, energy use per unit of GDP has declined; however, in absolute terms, energy use and associated GHG emissions have increased. Figure 10 shows trends in energy production in the region over the past two decades. With only 5.1 per cent of world population, North America consumes just over 24 per cent of global primary energy. Increasing domestic energy exploration is leading to new threats from air pollution, the potential for additional releases of oil to the environment and the fragmentation of landscapes, with impacts on biodiversity.
Continued urban sprawl and growing exurban development are leading to pressures on water quality, biodiversity, and air pollution.
In response, many states, provinces and municipalities have implemented smart growth and other strategies to manage sprawl, preserve farmland and green space, and protect ecosystem services. For example, the master plans of most Canadian cities include the control of sprawl, and in the US, 22 states have enacted laws to curb sprawl.
Water quality and availability vary across the region. Per capita water consumption is the highest in the world; however, this includes significant water contained in food exports; agriculture use accounts for 41 per cent of annual water withdrawals in the US and 1 2 per cent in Canada. Excessive groundwater withdrawal in the US remains a challenge. Steps are being taken to improve water use efficiency through conservation programmes in agriculture and for household use. Overall water quality in the region is the cleanest in the world. FHowever, there is significant variability and approximately 20 per cent of US watersheds face serious water quality challenges. Significant gains have been made in point-source pollution, but non-point source pollution remains a major difficulty and has become a priority for both countries. Excess nutrient run-off is an important problem, contributing to eutrophication of many US estuaries. Both countries are responding to water problems with national and transboundary Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) approaches to improve policy measures for these complex water issues. The human health consequences of environmental impacts are an emerging issue.

West Asia has made strides in environmental governance since Our Common Future, including establishing environmental institutions, enacting environmental regulations, developing environmental and sustainable development strategies, such as the sustainable development initiative in the Arab Region, and joining many of the MEAs. Nevertheless, continued population growth, military conflicts, and rapid development have resulted in a significant increase in environmental challenges and pressures on natural resources. The region is one of the most water-stressed in the world. Per capita freshwater availability is decreasing, while consumption is increasing. Water resources are overexploited with 80 per cent used for agriculture (see Figure 11). Institutional and policy reforms have been emphasizing a shift from water supply to demand management. An additional major challenge that impacts planning is the absence of agreements regulating shared water resources.

Unsustainable agricultural practices, overgrazing and rangeland cultivation, recreational activities, and urbanization have degraded vast land areas. Measures to mitigate land degradation and to protect threatened areas are well defined in national action plans to combat desertification. However, in many countries these plans are ineffective because they are not mainstreamed into national socio-economic development policies. Marine and coastal areas are threatened by urbanization, tourism infrastructure, industry, oil pollution, chemical contamination, invasive alien species and overfishing. Efforts to introduce Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) should be reinforced with strict protection and conservation measures to meet the fast-paced development. The urban environment is facing escalating challenges related to increased air pollution and increased wastes. Policies and successful measures have been implemented in several countries, such as phasing-out leaded gasoline, adopting zero-flaring policies, enhancing the use of natural gas as energy, and introducing effective waste management systems. Armed conflict has harmed human well-being, expanded the number of refugees, and resulted in the degradation of natural resources and ecological habitats. Regional cooperation in transboundary environmental problems and environmental management are undertaken by the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment (CAMRE). However, strengthening of institutions, capacity building, environmental legislation and enforcement are urgently required. Finally, peace and stability are essential for sustainable development in the region.

The Polar regions influence major environmental processes, and have direct impacts on global biodiversity and human well-being. The regions are interlinked with global climate change impacts, such as altered ocean currents and rising sea levels. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the world average, causing shrinking sea ice (see Figure 12), melting of glaciers as well as changes in vegetation. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are the largest contributors to the sea level rise from melting land ice. Persistent organic pollutants, although banned in most industrialized countries, are still used elsewhere and persist and accumulate in polar regions where they enter marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and accumulate in food chains. These toxic substances pose a threat to the integrity of the traditional food system and the health of indigenous peoples in the Arctic. Mercury from industrial emissions can pose a similar threat because it can be transported over long distances and transformed into methyl mercury, a Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP). Ozone depletion has resulted in increased ultraviolet radiation, with impacts on ecosystems and human health.

5 lessons and progress from the past two decades
Environmental changes affect human development options, with poor people being the most vulnerable. Environmental changes impact human well-being, human vulnerability, and people’s ability to cope or adapt. For example, conflicts, violence and persecution displace large civilian populations, forcing millions of people into marginal ecological areas within countries and across international boundaries. This undermines, sometimes for decades, sustainable livelihoods, economic development, and the capacity of ecosystems to meet an increased demand for resources.

More than 90 per cent of the people exposed to disasters live in the developing world. Millions are also affected in developed countries. Over the past 20 years, natural hazards (see Figure 13) such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, storms, tropical cyclones and hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and landslides have claimed more than 1.5 million lives and affected more than 200 million people annually. Between 1992 and 2001, floods were the most frequent natural disaster, killing nearly 100 000 and affecting more than 1.2 billion people worldwide. The capacity to adapt to and withstand hazards in some parts of the world is being eroded through reduced state protection schemes, the undermining of informal safety nets, poorly built or maintained infrastructure, conflict, and chronic illness.

However, progress has been made on several fronts over the last 20 years. The historical decline of the temperate forests has reversed, some regional air pollution problems, such as acid rain in Europe and North America, have been successfully addressed, major research advances have been made in agriculture on innovations for integrating conservation and development to ease biodiversity loss, reverse land degradation and foster environmental sustainability and, in some cities, environmental quality is better today than when Our Common Future was published in 1987.

There are also many cases in which problems persist even though proven solutions are known. In these cases, progress requires concerted, focused implementation of best practices, as in the example of recent initiatives to extend the leaded-petrol ban to countries where it is still used. There is substantial experience with a wide range of policy instruments that can be transferred, adapted and implemented (Table 2).
At the global level, strengthening UNEP and better cooperation among United Nations bodies and other institutions to make environment and sustainable development governance more efficient and effective has long been a goal of the international community. These efforts are ongoing in UNEP in followup to the Cartagena agreement on International Environmental Governance (IEG). Discussions on how to strengthen environment and sustainable development are also underway through the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
Various secretariats of MEAs and United Nations bodies have signed Memoranda of Understanding. Environmental cooperation also provides opportunities to create pathways for peace by promoting sustainable resource use between countries.
Regional environmental cooperation has also been strengthened since 1987. A number of regional environmental ministerial fora have been established, including the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), and Conference of Europe Environment Ministers (CEEM), the Forum of Ministers of the Environment of Latin America and the Caribbean, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment (CAMRE). The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has an environmental accord that is overseen by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC). The European Union (EU) provides a good example of the added value of strong political cooperation among nations, especially in establishing environmental regulations on a wide range of issues.
Coordination on environment and sustainable development issues is equally important at the national level. Here, coordination among MEA focal points and among ministries representing governments in various fora on development, finance, foreign affairs and environment needs to be encouraged.
Direct regulation plays a major role in achieving progress and is likely to continue doing so, even if the use of market force and soft instruments, such as the provision of information and technology transfer, play a more important role than before. By compiling successful experiences from global, regional, sub-regional, national and local initiatives the GEO process can provide some valuable lessons learned on general principles for public policy formulation and implementation.

Effective diffusion of innovative policies often results from governments and other actors learning from each other. Best practices are spread most effectively when there is monitoring and reporting of policies and outcomes. Almost all successful policy initiatives from the past two decades have been supported by robust environmental monitoring programmes. Such programmes are lacking in regard to many of the high priority problems identified in GEO-4.
Civil society and the private sector are also playing a growing role in decision-making and in the delivery of solutions through extended opportunities for environmental technology and innovation in some regions. The growing awareness of environmental problems, and better education programmes have also led to a broadening of corporate social responsibility (CSR). CSR and corporate financing of certain social and environmental activities have been encouraged by global initiatives that have stimulated companies to report not only on their economic activities but, also, on their social and environmental performance. The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), launched at the New York Stock Exchange in April 2006, had after six months been accepted by 94 institutional investors from 17 countries representing US$5 trillion in investments.

Through the GEO-4 scenario exercise, stakeholders explored the interplay between some of the environmental issues in atmosphere, land, water and biodiversity.
The scenarios are based on assumptions related to institutional and socio-political effectiveness, demographics, economic demand, trade and markets, scientific and technological innovation, value-systems and social and individual choices, and highlighted those areas of uncertainty in the coming decades. The following are the main elements of the four scenarios:
■ Markets First: the private sector, with active government support, pursues maximum economic growth as the best path to improve the environment and human well-being for all.
■ Policy First: the government sector, with active private- and civic-sector support, implements strong policies intended to improve the environment and human wellbeing, while still emphasizing economic development.
■ Security First: the government sector and the private sector vie for control in efforts to improve, or at least maintain, human well-being for mainly the rich and powerful in society.
■ Sustainability First: the civic, government and private sectors work collaboratively to improve the environment and human well-being for all, with a strong emphasis on equity.
There is an increasing understanding of how the environmental changes being recorded around the world are linked through time and space via a complex set of biophysical and social processes. These changes may continue even if the forces of change are removed, as evidenced by the stratospheric ozone depletion and the loss of species.
Such time lags have implications for the formulation and implementation of policy interventions. Biophysical and social systems can also reach tipping points, beyond which there are abrupt, accelerating, or potentially irreversible changes. The four GEO-4 scenarios show an increasing risk of crossing tipping points, even as some global environmental degradation trends are slowed or reversed at different rates towards the middle of the century.



6 going forward
The pressing environmental issues facing decision-makers today can be mapped along a continuum from
those where proven solutions are available, to those where both the understanding of the problem and its solutions are still emerging. In all cases, science has a key role to play in providing the best available information to enable informed decision-making. The long-term knowledge base of indigenous peoples in providing such knowledge should also be considered.
Existing institutions are vital in creating the right conditions for change. Further achievements can be brought about by following a two-track, complementary approach (see Figure 14):
n Expanding institutions and adapting policies that have already worked effectively for conventional problems into areas lacking such policies, especially in developing regions, and financing this endeavour; Supporting innovation that pursues new and emerging solutions for persistent environmental problems by using economic instruments and more adaptive approaches.

Building on recent gains

Over the last 20 years, the range of institutions and policy options for dealing with environmental problems has expanded and diversified. Investing in results-based management of existing environmental institutions can help strengthen capacities for determining environmental risks and trade-offs, promoting timely action, reducing the costs of inaction and integrating environment with development. Table 2 summarizes a simple categorization of environmental policies, which have evolved over the last two decades from command-and-control regulations to the creation of markets.
Direct regulation still plays a major role and is likely to continue doing so, even if the use of market forces and soft instruments (such as providing information) play a more important role than before. An effective toolbox would include a wide variety of instruments, often used together, that are customized to specific institutional setups, as well as the prevailing social and cultural situations.

When a new approach works well - whether in forest management, irrigation techniques or the protection of threatened species - the lessons learned during the process can help establish what becomes a new standard for best practices in that sector. Even if these practices do not provide the whole solution to an environmental problem, they are important incremental steps along the way towards solutions. Experiences from global, regional, national and local initiatives that address complex environmental issues across sectors have also provided some valuable lessons on general principles for public policy formulation and implementation. To increase the chance of success, policy-makers may:
■ Stimulate political will, through public awareness, education, and conflict-mediation systems;
■ Create the necessary legislative basis and environmental judiciary, minimize delays between policy decisions and implementation, and ensure sustainable financing systems are safeguarded from corruption;
■ Strengthen and reinforce the capacity of agencies and staff operating at local, national and international level;
■ Decentralize power to the lowest level appropriate for the decision, where it is usually more timely and meaningful;
■ Involve relevant stakeholders, such as through formal or informal partnerships, and transfer authority to stakeholders who have a relative advantage, stake and competence in assuming the responsibility;
■ Support and facilitate the active participation of women, local communities and marginalized and vulnerable groups in decision making;
■ Support research, monitoring, and information networking and develop specific management objectives, selecting appropriate and measurable indicators, and monitoring and assessing progress against these objectives.

Strong organizations are crucial for effective implementation of public policy. Since 1987, there has been an overabundance of organizational arrangements, especially at the global level. Significant opportunities for increased effectiveness are offered by the UN reform process initiated by the 2005 World Summit. The process identified the need for more efficient environmental activities within the UN, and is consistent with the IEG initiative. Coordination within the UN can be enhanced through joint programming and practical cooperation between UN agencies, such as UNEP and UNDP, and within the ""One UN"" approach at the country level. Calls for a UN or World Environment Organization (UNEO or WEO) have been made since the early 1970s. There is still much debate about whether there is a need for such an organization, however, and what form it could take.

Better treaty compliance can be achieved by overcoming the material limitations for Parties to meet their obligations, including administrative costs and the heavy reporting burden. There are now more than 500 international treaties and other agreements related to the environment, of which 323 are regional, and 302 date from the period between 1972 and the early 2000s (see Figure 15 on ratification of MEAs). Improved monitoring and compliance mechanisms, such as the establishment of a voluntary peer-review mechanism on compliance, can also contribute. Identified interlinkages and synergies between environmental challenges can serve as areas for cooperation among the treaties and for more effective implementation and capacity building at the national level.
The integration of environmental activities into the broader development framework
is at the heart of the MDG on achieving environmental sustainability. Improved efficiency and coherence can be achieved by integrating environmental mitigation and adaptation efforts into development policies.
A key role for environmental institutions to achieve this goal is to provide knowledge and promote awareness; identify targets, policies, regulations, tools and best practices; and monitor long-term achievements.

Striving to ensure more sustainable patterns of consumption and production is a key approach to mainstreaming the environment. Opportunities exist in the implementation of the multi-stakeholder Marrakech process, which supports regional and national initiatives to promote the shift towards such patterns. Efforts to link environmental policies with major public budgets represent another effective option for integration. A relatively small number of countries, including Canada and Norway, for example, review their budgets to ascertain the environmental impacts of proposed public spending. The EU requires an environmental impact assessment for spending on national projects from structural and regional funds.

Strengthened environmental knowledge

about interactions between people and the environment at all scales, based on the best-available scientific research (see Figure 16) and data, can be achieved by improving knowledge infrastructure and capacities, promoting interoperability of data systems and tools, and information networking, particularly in developing regions. Effective implementation of the Bali Strategic Plan on Technology Support and Capacity Building, adopted in February 2005 by the UNEP Governing Council, will strengthen the capacity of states on environmental issues at all levels. It calls for a bottom-up approach in identifying specific objectives, strategies and activities that need support. It also stresses the importance of, and national ownership and South-South cooperation for assessing overall needs and setting priorities. Learning about best practices can be facilitated, for instance, through web- based learning platforms and networks. These incremental gains should not be forgotten in pursuing solutions to all pressing environmental problems at the same time.
There is considerable scope for mobilizing financial resources to address environmental problems. Building intergovernmental partnerships and implementing outcomes of the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development can provide much-needed support. There may also be environmental and economic benefits in phasing out some subsidies. For instance, an International Atomic Energy Agency study of energy subsidies in eight developing countries, mostly in Asia, concluded that their annual economic growth would increase by over 0.7 per cent, while their CO2 emissions would go down by nearly 1 6 per cent, if the subsidies were eliminated. Green budgeting, the creation of conservation funds and economic instruments, such as user fees and charges, are among the tools that have been applied in various countries. Financing plans that allow local resource conservation to pay for itself over time can be developed, but local communities or domestic financial sources are often unable to make the initial seed investment. Liberalization of trade in goods-and-services of interest to developing countries could generate additional financial flows totalling about US$310 billion yearly. Realizing this potential, however, will depend on success in achieving an open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, which benefits countries at all stages of development. It will also depend on meaningful trade liberalization which takes into account impacts on the environment, and which does not compromise effective management of the environment.

Reducing people's vulnerability to environmental and socio-economic changes is one component of protecting and extending recent gains. This can involve strengthening local rights by, for example, developing institutional forms that are more inclusive of local concerns or strengthening resource tenure to give people secure access to their livelihood assets and increased control over how local resources are used. Reducing vulnerability includes access to better financial and technical support and information, and investing in the capacity to cope with natural disasters and adapt to climate change. Empowering women not only contributes to the widely shared objective of equity and justice, but also makes good economic, environmental and social sense. Evidence shows that finance schemes that target women can have higher-than-usual payoffs and more sustainable outcomes. Better access to education improves maternal health, creating a better starting point for the next generation.

Innovations and emerging solutions

For many problems, the benefits from early and ambitious action outweigh the costs. Scenarios on future global environmental changes suggest that implementing determined action in the present is cheaper than waiting for better solutions to come along. Delayed action also unfairly shifts the burden of paying such costs onto future generations, contradicting the principle of inter-generational equity. In particular, recent IPCC reports about the costs of inaction on climate change have raised the alarm about the need for action, and suggest that immediate measures are affordable for many countries. Innovative approaches are needed for society to make the necessary transition to a sustainable, low- carbon economy.
A number of structural innovations could form the basis of a more ambitious global policy agenda to enable such a transition. Contemporary approaches are moving, for example, towards collective learning and adaptive management. Effective adaptive governance depends on leadership and bridging organizations. Leaders are imperative for establishing a vision, building trust, generating knowledge, initiating partnerships among relevant actors, managing conflicts, and mobilizing broad support for change. Bridging organizations are often at the interface of scientific knowledge and policy or of local experience and research and policy. They reduce the cost of collaboration significantly and often perform important conflict resolution functions.
Adaptive governance approaches are well placed to manage uncertainty and periods of change. The rising price of oil, for example, has led to increased interest in other energy sources. Broad-based energy policies may
 benefit from an integrated multisectoral approach that addresses both the need to maintain biodiversity and vital ecosystem services, and the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
Greater emphasis is also being placed on economic instruments (see Table 3 for different types of instruments and applications). Natural resources - compared to financial, material and human resources - are the foundation for much of the wealth of countries. Managing this natural resources portfolio to maximize its returns and benefits over time is good investment.
The policy options available to influence economic drivers include green taxes, the creation of markets for ecosystem services, and environmental accounting. Governments are beginning to gain experience in implementing these instruments, although typically only at relatively small scales. Learning by doing can help develop new policy approaches to move development decisions in a sustainable direction.
Used properly, economic instruments provide market corrections, promote production efficiency or cost minimization, and facilitate flexible responses to changing circumstances. They can help economic development to foster environmental protection and vice- versa. Economic instruments may provide signals concerning resource scarcity and environmental damage which, in turn, can trigger more-efficient resource use and waste minimization. Instruments such as green taxes can raise revenues that may be used to improve environmental quality or reduce income taxes for the poor. Table 3 provides some examples of various economic instruments being applied to different environmental sectors.

In ecological tax reform and tax shifting, taxes on energy use and the consumption of other resources are increased, and corresponding reductions are often made on income tax. Although this has encountered stiff resistance from vested interests, ecological tax reforms have proved to be a stimulus for innovation and new employment opportunities. When introduced gradually and in ways that are revenue-neutral and easy to administer, these reforms may encourage environmentally conscious consumption patterns without having significant negative social distribution effects. Certain instruments, such as carbon taxes, that have a potentially significant impact on industry and national competitiveness, have been used by some countries. To date, however, carbon taxes have been introduced in only 12 countries, and their diffusion has been very slow.

A relatively new approach o-called payments for environmental or ecosystem services (PES) attempts to address the overexploitation of ecosystems by paying the individuals and communities that secure the supply of ecosystem services; the beneficiaries must pay for the services themselves. Costa Rica, brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and other de\eloping countries have pioneered PES schemes for the preservation of freshwater ecosystems, forests and biodiversity. Many PES schemes have originated in developed countries, particularly in the US, where it is estimated that the government spends at least US$1.7 billion a year to induce farmers to protect land. While the conservation goals may be laudable, the trade-distorting nature of some agricultural subsidies also needs to be considered.
Three main markets are emerging for payments for ecosystem services:
■ Watershed management, which may include control of floods, erosion, access to nutrients, sedimentation and water quality, as veil as maintenance of aquatic habitats and dry season flows;
■ biodiversity protection, which includes eco-label led products, ecotourism and payments for conservation of wildlife habitat;
■ Carbon sequestration, in which, for example, international buyers pay to plant new trees to absorb carbon, offsetting carbon emissions elsewhere.

Indicative of the growing interest in market mechanisms, the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2006 witnessed a booming global carbon market worth over U$$ 10 billion, 10 times the value of the previous year and more than the value of the entire US wheat crop in 2005 (US$7.1 billion).

Market failures are, however, not necessarily solved solely through market solutions,
A combination of market-based mechanisms and regulatory structures is often needed. The cap-and-trade model, in the case
of carbon emissions, is an example of
a regulatory framework defining overall emission limits before a market for emission credits can be established.

 CONCLUSION

conclusion
The intertwined environmental and developmental challenges that Our Common Future warned about in 1987
still exist, as do the associated policy challenges. Knowledge of the interlinkages between environment and development, and the impacts on human well-being, gained in the past two decades, can be used effectively for the transition towards sustainable development. Concerns about the global environment may have reached a tipping point of their own, with the growing realization that for many problems, the benefits of early action outweigh the costs. Now is the time to pursue the transition towards sustainable development supported by well-governed, innovative and results-oriented institutions, which can effectively respond to environmental challenges, particularly persistent ones.

The GEO-4 assessment process

Since 1997, UNEP has produced Global Environment Outlook (GEO) reports providing assessments of the interactions between environment and society. With its core mandate of ""keeping the global environment under review/' UNEP coordinated a series of scientific assessments that included extensive consultations and participatory processes, resulting in the production of GEO reports in 1997, 1999 and 2002.
The fourth assessment, Global Environment Outlook: environment for development {GEO-4), is the most comprehensive GEO process to date. It was designed to ensure synergy between science and policy, while maintaining its scientific credibility and making it responsive to policy needs and objectives. The launch in 2007 of the GEO-4 report coincides with the 20th anniversary of the launch of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future.
GEO-4 uses it as a reference to assess progress in addressing key environment and development issues.
GEO-4 highlights the vital role of the environment in development and, more importantly, for human well-being.
GEO-4 is more than a report: it is also a comprehensive consultative process which began in 2004. In February of that year, an intergovernmental consultation on strengthening the scientific base of UNEP, which involved more than 100 governments and 50 partner organizations, called for a further strengthening of the GEO process. The global consultation was followed by regional consultations in September-October 2004, which identified key regional and global environmental issues. Building on these consultations, the scope, objectives and process of the GEO-4 were finalized and adopted by the First Global Intergovernmental and Multistakeholder Consultation in February 2005.
The assessment was carried out by 10 chapter expert groups consisting of coordinating lead authors and lead authors
supported by chapter coordinators provided by the UNEP secretariat. The draft outputs from the expert groups were subjected to an additional round of regional consultations and two rounds of extensive expert and government peer review. The review process was overseen by chapter review

editors. The assessment was also guided and supported by a High-level Consultative Group of senior government policy-makers, funding partners, scientists and academics as well as representatives of some UN agencies, international organizations, the private sector, GEO collaborating centres and civil society.
In 10 chapters, the GEO-4 assessment provides: an overview of environmental issues; state-and-trends of the environment between 1987 and 2007; human dimensions of environmental change; an outlook for the future using four scenarios; and the policy options available to sustain our common future:
Chapter 1 :	Environment	for	Development
Chapter 2:	Atmosphere
Chapter 3:	Land
Chapter 4:	Water
Chapter 5:	Biodiversity
Chapter 6:	Sustaining a	Common	Future
Chapter 7: Vulnerability of People and the Environment: Challenges and Opportunities Chapter 8: Interlinkages: Governance for Sustainability Chapter 9: The Future Today
Chapter 10: From the Periphery to the Core of Decision Making - Options for Action
The Summary for Decision Makers (SDM) was prepared by UNEP with technical inputs from the coordinating lead authors and inputs from the members of the High-level Consultative Group. It underwent two rounds of extensive expert and government peer review. Finally, the SDM was subject to in-depth consideration by the Second Global Intergovernmental and Multistakeholder Consultation in September 2007. The consultation adopted a statement which endorsed the SDM.
The basis for this Summary for Decision Makers can be found in the GEO-4 chapters. Reference sources for graphics used in this report are provided at the end of the report.



KEY MESSAGES FOR DECISION MAKERS
 Humankind depends on the environment, which is critical for both development and human well-being. Natural resources - compared to financial, material and human resources - are the foundation for much of the wealth of countries. Environmental change can affect peoples security, health, social relations and material needs.


There is evidence of unprecedented environmental
change at global and regional levels:
■ The Earth's surface is warming. This is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level. Other major impacts, include changes in water availability, land degradation, food security, and loss
of biodiversity. The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heat waves, storms, floods and droughts would dramatically affect many millions of people including those in small island states and Polar regions. While in the past century the global average temperature increased by 0.74°C, the best estimate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for additional warming over the current century is projected to be from 1.8 to 4.0°C. Climate change may further exacerbate the loss of biodiversity and degradation of land, soil, forest, freshwater and oceans.
■ More than 2 million people globally die prematurely every year due to outdoor and indoor air pollution. Although air pollution has decreased in some cities due to technological and policy measures, increasing emissions
in other cities are intensifying the challenges. Indoor air pollution due to the improper burning of solid biomass fuels imposes an enormous health burden.
■ The ""hole"" in the stratospheric ozone layer over the Antarctic - the layer that protects people from harmful ultraviolet radiation
- is now the largest it has ever been. Due to decreased emissions of ozone depleting substances and assuming full Montreal Protocol compliance, the ozone layer is expected to recover, but not until between 2060 and 2075 as a result of long lag times.
■ Unsustainable land use and climate change are driving land degradation, including soil erosion, nutrient depletion, water scarcity,salinity, desertification, and the disruption of biological cycles. Poor people suffer disproportionately from the effects of land degradation, especially in the drylands, which support some 2 billion people, 90 per cent of whom live in developing countries.
■ The per capita availability of freshwater is declining globally, and contaminated water remains the greatest single environmental cause of human sickness and death. If present trends continue, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025, and two-thirds of the people in the world could be subject to water stress. The decline of quantity and quality of surface and groundwater is impacting aquatic ecosystems and their services.
■ Aquatic ecosystems continue to be heavily exploited, putting at risk sustainability of food supplies and biodiversity. Global marine and freshwater fish catches show large-scale declines, caused mostly by persistent overfishing.
■ The great majority of well-studied species are declining in distribution, abundance or both. Although the decline in the area of temperate forest has been reversed, with an annual increase of 30 000 km2 between 1990 and 2005, deforestation in the tropics continued
at an annual rate of 1 30 000 km2 during the same period. More than 16 000 species have been identified as threatened with extinction.
These unprecedented changes are due to human activities in an increasingly globalized, industrialized and interconnected world, driven by expanding flows of goods, services, capital, people, technologies, information, ideas and labour, even affecting isolated populations. The responsibility for global environmental pressures is not equally distributed throughout the world. For instance, in 2004, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Annex 1 countries with 20 per cent of world population produced 57 per cent of gross world product based on purchasing power parity and accounted for 46 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial development, natural resource extraction and carbon-intensive industrial production, may have significant environmental consequences, which need to be addressed. Responses include the use of the best available technologies and practices as appropriate.
Environmental change affects human development options, with poor people being the most vulnerable. For example, in the period between 1992 and 2001, floods were the most frequent natural disaster, killing nearly 100 000 people and affecting more than 1.2 billion people. More than 90 per cent of the people exposed to disasters live in the developing world.
Biophysical and social systems can reach tipping points, beyond which there are abrupt, accelerating, or potentially irreversible changes.
The four GEO-4 scenarios show an increasing risk of crossing tipping points, even as some global environmental degradation trends are slowed or reversed at different rates towards the middle of the century. Changes in biophysical and social systems may continue even if the forces of change are removed, as evidenced in the stratospheric ozone depletion and the loss of species.
The transition towards sustainable development needs to be pursued more intensively by nations and the international community, including through capacity building and technological support to developing countries. Actions to reduce the drivers of environmental change by all stakeholders, including the private sector and consumers, require trade-offs, which may involve hard choices, among different values and concerns.
Decision-makers can promote timely action by integrating prevention, mitigation and adaptation efforts into the core of decision-making through sustained efforts which include:
■ Reducing people's vulnerability to
environmental and socio-economic changes by decentralization, strengthening resource rights of local people, improving access to financial and technical support, improving capacities to cope with natural disasters, and empowering women and vulnerable groups;
■ 
Integrating environmental activities into the broader development framework, including by ascertaining the environmental impacts of proposed public spending, identifying sectoral and inter-sectoral environmental targets, promoting best practices, and monitoring longterm achievements;
■ Enhancing treaty compliance by overcoming administrative costs and the heavy reporting burden of Parties, improving monitoring and compliance, and enhancing coordination, particularly at national level;
■ Creating enabling environments for innovations and emerging solutions by using economic instruments, new and existing technologies, empowerment of stakeholders, and more adaptive approaches which break away from the traditional segmented institutional management and production systems, and result in more sustainable consumption and production patterns;
■ Strengthening environmental knowledge, education and awareness by making the best-available scientific research and data accessible through improved monitoring, assessments and knowledge infrastructure, building on the rapid developments in information and communication technologies;
■ Mobilizing financial resources to address environmental problems through innovative approaches, including payments for ecosystem services while achieving an open, non- discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system as well as meaningful trade liberalization benefiting countries at all stages of development.
Knowledge on the interlinkages between environment and development, and the impacts on human well-being, gained since the release of Our Common Future, the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, can be used effectively for the transition towards sustainable development. Concerns about the global environment may have reached a tipping point of their own, with the growing realization that, for many problems, the benefits of early action outweigh the costs. Now is the time to pursue the transition towards sustainable development supported by well-governed, innovative and results-oriented institutions.


	INTRODUCTION

       In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) presented its report, Our Common Future. The Brundtland Commission, as it was known, brought international attention to the concept of sustainable development - a challenge to meet today's development needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Twenty years on, the challenges as set out in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are even more profound, and the importance of the environment in sustaining development is becoming ever clearer.

	ENVIRONMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT
       Development depends on the environment while its impacts on the environment affect human well-being. The world has changed radically over the past two decades. Significant changes to geopolitical borders have occurred. Global population has grown from 5 billion to 6.7 billion. There has been a net annual rise in gross domestic product (GDP) per person of almost 2 per cent and continued increases in trade volume, CO2 emissions and agricultural land (see Figure 1). Technological innovations have improved livelihoods and health. Low transportation costs, coupled with market liberalization and the rapid development of telecommunications have fuelled globalization and altered trade patterns, expanding the flow of goods, services, capital, people, technologies, information, ideas and labour. While millions have worked their way out of poverty and have access to improved services, such as healthcare, there are still more than 1 billion poor people in the world. They lack essential services such as clean water, adequate nutrition, shelter and clean energy, making them especially vulnerable to environmental and socio-economic changes.



The responsibility for the mounting global environmental pressures is not equally distributed throughout the world. For instance, in 2004, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Annex 1 countries with 20 per cent of world population, produced 57 per cent of gross world product based on purchasing power parity and accounted for 46 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Changing drivers and pressures, including the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas, the widening gap between the richest and the poorest, and growth in demand for energy, among other factors, have led to a deepening disparity in consumption patterns and in outsourcing of environmentally damaging production processes.
Long term sustainable development aimed at improving human well-being entails:
■ increasing the asset base and its productivity;
■ empowering poor people and marginalized communities;
■ reducing and managing risks; and
■ taking a long-term perspective with regard to intra- and inter-generational equity.
Ecosystems provide the natural resources capital needed for development. Natural resources, account for more than a quarter of the wealth of low-income countries and somewhat less in higher income countries. Changes in ecosystem services can affect natural resources as well as financial, material, and human assets. All people - rich and poor, urban and rural - rely on natural resources through a complex web of interactions. The GEO conceptual framework (see back page) illustrates many of the links between environmental change and peoples security, health, social relations and material needs, all of which are components of human well-being. Sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism and mining are instrumental in utilizing natural resources and ecosystem services.



 The normative framework for human development is reflected in the internationally agreed development goals in the Millennium Declaration. Environmental sustainability is one of the development goals critical to achieving the other targets. The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, for example, is dependent on sustainable agriculture which, in turn, relies on soils, water and ecological processes.
 Increasingly, there is evidence that investment in environmental management results in increased income generation for the rural poor It can also result in income generation for industries in developed countries

that produce environmental remediation equipment; for example, the environmental industry is Denmark's second largest export.
It is estimated that 80 per cent of people in developing countries rely on traditional medicines, and mote than half of the most frequently prescribed drugs in developed countries derive from natural resources. Worldwide, moie than 1.3 billion people depend on fisheries, forests and agriculture for employment. Communities in resource dependent countries are, therefore, especially vulnerable to environmental degradation, climate change, and the loss of services from ecosystems. In the Adagon watershed in India, for example, the
annual days of employment rose from 75 to 200 after ecosystem restoration was undertaken. Traditional management in Fiji to promote recovery of fisheries through a no-take area in a marine coastal zone resulted in a 35-43 per cent increase in income over three years.
Knowledge about the value of ecosystem services and the role of environment in supporting development has improved over the last two decades. A further enhancement of such knowledge can facilitate the transition to sustainable development. This transition will require trade-offs, and hard choices, among different values and concerns in society.

	ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Changes in the Earths environment
We now have evidence of unprecedented environmental changes at global and regional levels. These unprecedented changes are due to human activities in an increasingly globalized, industrialized and interconnected world, driven by expanding flows of goods, services, capital, people, technologies, information, ideas and labour, even affecting isolated populations. The key changes and associated challenges and opportunities are presented below.
Atmosphere
Atmospheric changes have major implications for human well-being. Since Our Common Future considered the topic of climate change, there has been a sharp and continuing rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere. Climate change (including global warming) is under way, and an average temperature increase of 0.74°C over the past century has been recorded. This trend, in which 1 1 of the last 1 2 years (1 995-2006) rank among the 1 2 warmest years since 1 850, is virtually certain. Impacts are already evident and include changes in water availability, spread of waterborne disease vectors, food security, sea-level and ice cover as exemplified by melting of the Greenland ice sheet (see Figure 2). Anthropogenic GFHG emissions (principally carbon dioxide, CO2) are the main drivers of change. The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts would dramatically affect many millions of people. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects an increase in the global temperature of 1.8–4°C by the end of this century. This will lead to potentially massive consequences, especially for the most vulnerable, poor and disadvantaged people who contribute to climate change to a lesser extent. Even if atmospheric concentrations of GHGs were to be stabilized today, land and ocean temperatures would increase for decades and sea levels would rise for centuries.
Adaptation to climate change is necessary
even if major mitigation measures are rapidly implemented. The array of potential adaptive responses available to human societies is very large, ranging from purely technological (such
as sea defences), through behavioural (such
as altered food and recreational choices) to managerial (such as modified farm practices), and policy (such as planning regulations). However, there are formidable barriers to adaptation. For developing countries, availability of resources and building adaptive capacity are particularly important.
Mitigation and adaptation to climate change can be integrated into development policies
by pursuing innovative and emerging solutions, which will also create new opportunities and jobs. The use of economic policy instruments and public and private sector investments in new technologies, clean and renewable energy, energy efficiency, nuclear energy and carbon sequestration are some of the many options already being used.
More than 2 million people are estimated to
die prematurely each year due to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Severe indoor air pollution occurs in many poor communities when biomass and coal are used for cooking and heating in enclosed places without adequate ventilation. Outdoor air pollution (see Figure 3) arises from many sources, including industrial processes, motor vehicles, energy generation, and wildfires. Although air quality has improved dramatically in some cities, many areas still suffer from excessive air pollution, resulting in severe health impacts.

Long-range transport of a variety of air pollutants also remains an issue of concern for human and ecosystem health.
The “hole” in the stratospheric ozone layer over the Antarctic – the layer that protects people from harmful ultraviolet radiation – is now the largest it has ever been. Due to decreased emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODS), the ozone layer is expected to recover, assuming full Montreal Protocol compliance, but not until between 2060 and 2075 as a result of long lag times. Early precautionary action on stratospheric ozone depletion was taken before the impacts were fully evident.
In 1987, the international community, through cooperation among developing and developed countries, agreed to phase out production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons and other ODS, through the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. These substances ha\e undergone a massive phaseout over the past 20 years. Consequently, by 2004 the emissions of OD$ are about 20 per cent of their 1990 level. As ODS were also GHGs, the treaty has simultaneously contributed to mitigating climate change. The protocol represents a global success story brought about, among others, by use of economic incentives, increased private investments, and enhanced public awareness.
Land
Unsustainable land and water use, and the impacts of climate change are driving land degradation, including soil erosion, nutrient depletion, water scarcity, salinity, chemical contamination and disruption of biological cycles. The cumulative effects of these changes threaten food security, biodiversity, and carbon fixation and storage. Poor people suffer disproportionately from the effects of land degradation, especially in the drylands, which support some two billion people, 90 per cent of whom live in developing countries.
One example of long-term success in combating land degradation is in the Great Plains of the United States, where a comprehensive package of measures was first introduced in the 1930s. As a result, natural, social, institutional and financial capital has been rebuilt and maintained to the present day. The Land Care programme in Australia is another successful example. In Africa and other developing regions, many countries have embarked on national action programmes to combat desertification within the framework cf the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).

The decline in the area of temperate forest

has been reversed with an average annual increase of 30 000 km2 between 1990 and 2005. However, deforestation in the tropics has continued at an average annual rate of 130 000 km2, with serious implications for GHG gas concentrations and biodiversity loss. Declines in natural forest area are partially countered by ecological restoration efforts, investment in planted forests, and more efficient use of wood products. More forest is being designated for ecosystem services but effective management is required to maintain and restore ecosystems.

The release of harmful and persistent pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic chemicals, from mining, manufacturing, sewage, energy and transport emissions, the use of agro- chemicals, and from leaking stockpiles of obsolete chemicals and products, remains a problem for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Although there has been progress in dealing with pollution in the industrialized countries, mainly through regulation, achieving an acceptable level of safety worldwide requires strengthening of institutional and technical capacities in all countries.

 The average population density in coastal areas is now twice as high as the global average. More than 100 million people live in areas no more than one metre above mean sea-level (see Figure 4); 21 of the worlds 33 mega-cities are located in coastal areas, with most of them in developing countries. Poor planning and the loss of key ecosystems such as wetlands, mangroves and coral reefs, and sea level rise due to climate change, are increasing the risk of flooding and reducing coastal protection from storms, tsunamis and erosion.
Water
 Contaminated water remains the greatest cause of human sickness and death on a global scale. The per capita availability of freshwater is declining, in part because of excessive withdrawals of surface and groundwater. If present trends continue, many countries will not meet their MDGs relating to water. About 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025 and two-thirds of the people in the world could be subject to water stress, with the GEO-4 scenarios indicating that there could be more than 5.1 billion people living under such conditions in 2050.
 Since agriculture accounts for more than 70 per cent of global water-use, it is a logical target for conservation management. Development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has enhanced many aspects of human well-being and ecosystem health, through improved water availability and quality both in catchments and in their respective coastal zones.
The worlds oceans are the primary regulator of global climate and an important sink for GHGs (see Figure 5), leading, for example, to ocean acidification. At watershed, regional and ocean basin scales, the water cycle is being affected by long-term changes in climate, altering precipitation patterns. Climate changes are also causing major reductions in Arctic sea ice cover, and the accelerated melting of permafrost and mountain glaciers, and Arctic land ice. These in turn have serious impacts on the security of communities in the Arctic, in glacier-fed river basins and deltas, and in low-lying coastal areas, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) worldwide. Concerted global actions are needed to address the root causes, while local efforts can reduce human vulnerability.
Eutrophication of inland and coastal waters caused by excessive nutrient loads from sources such as agricultural fertilizer causes sporadic major fish kills, and threatens human health and livelihoods. The deterioration of inland and coastal water quality is being exacerbated by other pollutants from land-based sources, particularly, municipal wastewater, and urban run-off.
Aquatic ecosystems continue to be heavily exploited, putting at risk sustainability of food supplies and biodiversity. Global marine and freshwater fish catches show large- scale declines, caused mostly by persistent overfishing. Total marine catches are being sustained only by fishing ever further offshore and deeper in the oceans and progressively lower down the food chain. Freshwater stocks suffer from habitat degradation and altered thermal regimes related to climate change and water impoundment.
Biodiversity
Biodiversity decline and loss of ecosystem services continue to be a major global threat to future development. The reduction in distribution and functioning of land, freshwater and marine biodiversity is more rapid than at any time in human history. Ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and drylands are being transformed and, in some cases, irreversibly degraded.

Rates of species extinction are increasing.
The great majority of well-studied species, including commercially important fish stocks, are declining in distribution or abundance or both. Genetic diversity of agricultural and other species is widely considered to be in decline.
Despite the importance of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, they are being modified in extent and composition by people at an unprecedented rate, with little understanding of the implications this will have in terms of their ability to function and provide services in the future. Figure 6 highlights the status of terrestrial ecosystems.
Biodiversity plays multiple roles in the daily lives of people through the supply of ecosystem services. In agriculture, biodiversity contributes to regulating and supporting services through soil formation, nutrient cycling, and pollination. Biodiversity is the basis for cultural services through spiritual and aesthetic benefits, and amenity values from ecotourism. Some economic estimates are available, for example, the value of the regulating services provided by honeybees as pollinators for crops has been estimated at well over US$2 billion per year, and the annual world fish catch is valued at US$58 billion.
In recognition of the importance of biodiversity and the fact that poor people in rural and remote areas tend to be the most directly affected by
the deterioration or loss of ecosystem services, many governments have established and adopted the 2010 biodiversity target to reduce the rate
of loss of biodiversity at global, regional and national scales. The target was adopted by
the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD),
and endorsed by the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD).
There have been local success stories with the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, particularly where economic incentives have been made available, such as for ecotourism, biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices, certification schemes and various initiatives on payments for ecosystem services. However,
at a global level, and in most regions of the world, biodiversity continues to be lost because current policies and economic systems do not incorporate the values of biodiversity effectively in either the political or the market systems, and many policies that are already in place are yet to be fully implemented.


4 Regional perspectives
The UNEP regions share common concerns about a number
of critical environmental and sustainability issues, yet face tremendous differences in their challenges. Strong interdependencies exist and are reinforced by globalization and trade, with growing demand on resources in and across the regions.
Significant improvements in human well- being have been achieved globally over the last 20 years. However, there are still more than 1 billion poor people who lack essential services and who are not buffered against environmental and socio-economic changes. Many countries will not meet the 2015 targets of the MDGs. Addressing vulnerability provides opportunities to meet these goals.

Throughout the world, recurring patterns of vulnerability can be found, including in industrialized and developing regions, and urban and rural areas. Examples of these include contaminated sites, drylands, energy security and, urbanization in coastal zones. The most vulnerable groups include the poor, indigenous populations, women and children in both developed and developing countries. Analysis of representative patterns of vulnerability in different regions shows the unequal distribution of risks for specific groups of people. Although vulnerability is contextes and-site-specific, certain common elements can be observed across regions, scales and contexts. Table 1 lists the environmental issues which were identified by regional consultations in September-October 2004.

The following sections highlight environmental challenges and opportunities of the regions.
Africa's land is under pressure from a growing population, natural disasters such as drought and floods, desertification, the inappropriate use of technology and chemicals, and poverty. In addition to threatening the livelihoods of the rural poor, land degradation has widespread effects on Africa's river catchments, forests and agricultural land, and ecosystem services. Per capita access to land is declining even as the region struggles to increase food production per unit area. Per capita agricultural production declined by 0.4 per cent between 2000 and 2004. Climate change and more frequent droughts and floods in Africa, are exacerbating land degradation. Africa is one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change and has the least adaptive capacity. Water and sanitation are also priority issues for most African countries. Despite an overall improvement in the coverage of water supply between 1 990 and 2002, the regional projection to 2015 still falls below the MDG target of 75 per cent coverage.
The region continues to be at risk from hazardous and electronic waste dumping due to inadequate monitoring capacities and institutional mechanisms to manage such waste. Africa holds at least 50 000 tonnes of obsolete pesticides which threaten both people and the environment. Lack of environmentally friendly technology is a major problem in Africa that should be dealt with through technology transfers, taking into consideration the preservation of cultural heritage. Although there are efforts to manage the environment through the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), initiatives such as the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) environment action plan, land and agrarian reforms, and integrated land and water management programmes, policy shortcomings still exist, and so do unfair agricultural subsidies in developed regions which undermine the profitability of farming and livelihoods of small landholders in Africa.
In Asia and the Pacific, environmental change is driven by rapid population growth, changing consumption patterns accompanying higher incomes, and burgeoning industrial and urban development. Various factors have led to an increase in urban air pollution: a highly urbanized population; poorly planned municipal development and transport services; a 2.5 times increase in the use of passenger cars over the last two decades (see Figure 7); and haze pollution from forest fires and peri-urban industries in Southeast Asia. Air pollution causes the premature deaths of about 500 000 people annually. Many countries have, in recent years, initiated a switch from conventional fossil fuels to cleaner renewable forms of energy. Excessive and inefficient use of water, industrial pollution, climatic variability and natural disasters ate major causes of water stress. Although there has been remarkable progress in the provision of improved drinking water over the last decade, some 655 million people in the region (1 7.6 percent) still lack access to safe water
The population pressure on marginal land and climate-re feted extremes in the past few decades pose a risk to terrestrial and marine biodiversity in the region. Rapid changes in consumption patterns have fed
to the generation of large quantities of electric and electronic waste, and toxic and hazardous waste. The illegal traffic in these wastes poses new, growing challenges. Although most countries have developed extensive domestic laws, regulations and standards related to the environment and participate in global action through multilateral and bilateral agreements, the challenging task is to implement those laws and regulations. Rapid introduction of innovative and energy efficient technology should improve environmental conditions in the region.

Europe is a region of great environmental and socio-economic diversity. Economic recovery in the past two decades has resulted in an increase of national income in many countries across the region. This, together with the growing number of individual households, is driving environmental change. The region has made progress in decoupling economic growth from resource use, although per capita household consumption is steadily increasing. Recently, growing public awareness underpinned by rising prices, has given new political momentum to climate change policies. Since 1987, GHG emissions (see Figure 8) from the energy sector have been reduced in some countries in Western Europe, although they have increased across the region as a whole. Emissions of air pollutants are largely driven by the demand for greater mobility, including increasing use of private transport and deterioration of public transport systems in many countries.
Despite much progress, poor water and urban air quality still cause substantial problems in some parts of Eastern and Southern Europe. Intensification and land abandonment are the two major trends in agriculture having impacts on biodiversity, as well as increasing the risk of land degradation and desertification, especially in southern parts of the region. Transport infrastructure is fragmenting landscapes and reducing biodiversity.
With its many action plans, environmental institutions and legal instruments, the region has extensive experience with environmental cooperation. Easier to manage environmental problems (e.g., point-source air and water pollution) have been effectively addressed in much of Central and Western Europe, but remain challenges in many Eastern European countries. The use of market-based instruments in environmental policy has gained ground substantially in Europe, especially in the area of taxes, charges and tradeable permits. Comprehensive systems of pollution charges for air and water are being implemented and resource use and waste taxes are being introduced. More efficient production and consumption patterns need to be established, and good governance mechanisms and lessons learned exchanged within the region, to achieve sustainable development.
The Latin America and the Caribbean region is the most urbanized in the developing world, with 77 per cent of the total population living in cities, and urbanization rates are still increasing. The challenge for developing and implementing urban environmental policies is, therefore, considerable. There has been relative success in improving the quality of fuels, public transport systems (Bogota, Colombia, and Curitiba, Brazil), air quality management (major Mexican cities), water law reforms (Chile), and community-based solid waste management schemes. Nevertheless, urban air pollution is high and increasing in smaller cities, untreated and domestic and industrial waste and waters are a growing problem, and domestic waste is generally not treated, contributing to water pollution.

The rich biodiversity in the region is threatened by forest conversion to pastures, infrastructure and urban areas. These threats are contributing to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as the loss of indigenous cultures and knowledge. Land degradation, resulting from deforestation, overgrazing and inappropriate irrigation is affecting 15.7 per cent of the region. Integrated prevention and control programmes are helping to decrease annual deforestation rates in some areas, and protected areas have almost doubled over the last two decades now covering 10.5 per cent of the land base. New efforts are being made to conserve terrestrial and marine corridors, such as the Meso-American Biological Corridor and those in the Amazon.
Although Latin America is responsible for only 5 per cent of the global GHG emissions and represents 8 per cent of the total world population, climate change is projected to significantly affect the region. The impacts include rising sea levels, more hurricanes and storms (see Figure 9), more pronounced droughts and floods associated with El Nino events, decline in water supplies stored in glaciers and declines in crop and livestock productivity. Particularly vulnerable are tropical rain forests, mangroves and coral reefs, mountain ecosystems, coastal wetlands and SIDS. Extreme climatic events have increased over the past 20 years.
The development of national climate change strategies is critical in this regard. Declining water quality, climate change and algal blooms have contributed to the rise in water-borne diseases in some coastal regions.
 
Most successful responses to environmental issues in the region have involved command- and-control measures. However, emerging policies have combined these approaches with economic instruments (including application of the polluter-pays-principle). Payments for ecosystem services are being implemented in several countries (such as Costa Rica, Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico) to protect biodiversity.
The use of economic instruments and effective compliance with environmental law need coupling with participatory and ecologically oriented urban planning as the strategic basis for sustainability.

In North America, the multi-stakeholder process identified energy and climate change, freshwater stress, and sprawl as major environmental issues facing the region. North Americas growing economy and population contribute to the ongoing environmental challenges. The region is a leader in research in environmental science and reporting, integrating the public into environmental decision making, providing timely access to information on environmental conditions, and the production of goods-and-services that mitigate or prevent environmental damage. A solid foundation of legislation from the 1970s, and newer innovative market-based programmes and modes for paying for ecosystem services, provide incentives for controlling pollution and conserving natural resources. Canada has signed the Kyoto Protocol and produced a plan to become more energy-efficient.
As a measure of progress, energy use per unit of GDP has declined; however, in absolute terms, energy use and associated GHG emissions have increased. Figure 10 shows trends in energy production in the region over the past two decades. With only 5.1 per cent of world population, North America consumes just over 24 per cent of global primary energy. Increasing domestic energy exploration is leading to new threats from air pollution, the potential for additional releases of oil to the environment and the fragmentation of landscapes, with impacts on biodiversity.
Continued urban sprawl and growing exurban development are leading to pressures on water quality, biodiversity, and air pollution.
In response, many states, provinces and municipalities have implemented smart growth and other strategies to manage sprawl, preserve farmland and green space, and protect ecosystem services. For example, the master plans of most Canadian cities include the control of sprawl, and in the US, 22 states have enacted laws to curb sprawl.
Water quality and availability vary across the region. Per capita water consumption is the highest in the world; however, this includes significant water contained in food exports; agriculture use accounts for 41 per cent of annual water withdrawals in the US and 1 2 per cent in Canada. Excessive groundwater withdrawal in the US remains a challenge. Steps are being taken to improve water use efficiency through conservation programmes in agriculture and for household use. Overall water quality in the region is the cleanest in the world. FHowever, there is significant variability and approximately 20 per cent of US watersheds face serious water quality challenges. Significant gains have been made in point-source pollution, but non-point source pollution remains a major difficulty and has become a priority for both countries. Excess nutrient run-off is an important problem, contributing to eutrophication of many US estuaries. Both countries are responding to water problems with national and transboundary Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) approaches to improve policy measures for these complex water issues. The human health consequences of environmental impacts are an emerging issue.

West Asia has made strides in environmental governance since Our Common Future, including establishing environmental institutions, enacting environmental regulations, developing environmental and sustainable development strategies, such as the sustainable development initiative in the Arab Region, and joining many of the MEAs. Nevertheless, continued population growth, military conflicts, and rapid development have resulted in a significant increase in environmental challenges and pressures on natural resources. The region is one of the most water-stressed in the world. Per capita freshwater availability is decreasing, while consumption is increasing. Water resources are overexploited with 80 per cent used for agriculture (see Figure 11). Institutional and policy reforms have been emphasizing a shift from water supply to demand management. An additional major challenge that impacts planning is the absence of agreements regulating shared water resources.

Unsustainable agricultural practices, overgrazing and rangeland cultivation, recreational activities, and urbanization have degraded vast land areas. Measures to mitigate land degradation and to protect threatened areas are well defined in national action plans to combat desertification. However, in many countries these plans are ineffective because they are not mainstreamed into national socio-economic development policies. Marine and coastal areas are threatened by urbanization, tourism infrastructure, industry, oil pollution, chemical contamination, invasive alien species and overfishing. Efforts to introduce Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) should be reinforced with strict protection and conservation measures to meet the fast-paced development. The urban environment is facing escalating challenges related to increased air pollution and increased wastes. Policies and successful measures have been implemented in several countries, such as phasing-out leaded gasoline, adopting zero-flaring policies, enhancing the use of natural gas as energy, and introducing effective waste management systems. Armed conflict has harmed human well-being, expanded the number of refugees, and resulted in the degradation of natural resources and ecological habitats. Regional cooperation in transboundary environmental problems and environmental management are undertaken by the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment (CAMRE). However, strengthening of institutions, capacity building, environmental legislation and enforcement are urgently required. Finally, peace and stability are essential for sustainable development in the region.

The Polar regions influence major environmental processes, and have direct impacts on global biodiversity and human well-being. The regions are interlinked with global climate change impacts, such as altered ocean currents and rising sea levels. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the world average, causing shrinking sea ice (see Figure 12), melting of glaciers as well as changes in vegetation. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are the largest contributors to the sea level rise from melting land ice. Persistent organic pollutants, although banned in most industrialized countries, are still used elsewhere and persist and accumulate in polar regions where they enter marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and accumulate in food chains. These toxic substances pose a threat to the integrity of the traditional food system and the health of indigenous peoples in the Arctic. Mercury from industrial emissions can pose a similar threat because it can be transported over long distances and transformed into methyl mercury, a Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP). Ozone depletion has resulted in increased ultraviolet radiation, with impacts on ecosystems and human health.

5 lessons and progress from the past two decades
Environmental changes affect human development options, with poor people being the most vulnerable. Environmental changes impact human well-being, human vulnerability, and people’s ability to cope or adapt. For example, conflicts, violence and persecution displace large civilian populations, forcing millions of people into marginal ecological areas within countries and across international boundaries. This undermines, sometimes for decades, sustainable livelihoods, economic development, and the capacity of ecosystems to meet an increased demand for resources.

More than 90 per cent of the people exposed to disasters live in the developing world. Millions are also affected in developed countries. Over the past 20 years, natural hazards (see Figure 13) such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, storms, tropical cyclones and hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and landslides have claimed more than 1.5 million lives and affected more than 200 million people annually. Between 1992 and 2001, floods were the most frequent natural disaster, killing nearly 100 000 and affecting more than 1.2 billion people worldwide. The capacity to adapt to and withstand hazards in some parts of the world is being eroded through reduced state protection schemes, the undermining of informal safety nets, poorly built or maintained infrastructure, conflict, and chronic illness.

However, progress has been made on several fronts over the last 20 years. The historical decline of the temperate forests has reversed, some regional air pollution problems, such as acid rain in Europe and North America, have been successfully addressed, major research advances have been made in agriculture on innovations for integrating conservation and development to ease biodiversity loss, reverse land degradation and foster environmental sustainability and, in some cities, environmental quality is better today than when Our Common Future was published in 1987.

There are also many cases in which problems persist even though proven solutions are known. In these cases, progress requires concerted, focused implementation of best practices, as in the example of recent initiatives to extend the leaded-petrol ban to countries where it is still used. There is substantial experience with a wide range of policy instruments that can be transferred, adapted and implemented (Table 2).
At the global level, strengthening UNEP and better cooperation among United Nations bodies and other institutions to make environment and sustainable development governance more efficient and effective has long been a goal of the international community. These efforts are ongoing in UNEP in followup to the Cartagena agreement on International Environmental Governance (IEG). Discussions on how to strengthen environment and sustainable development are also underway through the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
Various secretariats of MEAs and United Nations bodies have signed Memoranda of Understanding. Environmental cooperation also provides opportunities to create pathways for peace by promoting sustainable resource use between countries.
Regional environmental cooperation has also been strengthened since 1987. A number of regional environmental ministerial fora have been established, including the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), and Conference of Europe Environment Ministers (CEEM), the Forum of Ministers of the Environment of Latin America and the Caribbean, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment (CAMRE). The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has an environmental accord that is overseen by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC). The European Union (EU) provides a good example of the added value of strong political cooperation among nations, especially in establishing environmental regulations on a wide range of issues.
Coordination on environment and sustainable development issues is equally important at the national level. Here, coordination among MEA focal points and among ministries representing governments in various fora on development, finance, foreign affairs and environment needs to be encouraged.
Direct regulation plays a major role in achieving progress and is likely to continue doing so, even if the use of market force and soft instruments, such as the provision of information and technology transfer, play a more important role than before. By compiling successful experiences from global, regional, sub-regional, national and local initiatives the GEO process can provide some valuable lessons learned on general principles for public policy formulation and implementation.

Effective diffusion of innovative policies often results from governments and other actors learning from each other. Best practices are spread most effectively when there is monitoring and reporting of policies and outcomes. Almost all successful policy initiatives from the past two decades have been supported by robust environmental monitoring programmes. Such programmes are lacking in regard to many of the high priority problems identified in GEO-4.
Civil society and the private sector are also playing a growing role in decision-making and in the delivery of solutions through extended opportunities for environmental technology and innovation in some regions. The growing awareness of environmental problems, and better education programmes have also led to a broadening of corporate social responsibility (CSR). CSR and corporate financing of certain social and environmental activities have been encouraged by global initiatives that have stimulated companies to report not only on their economic activities but, also, on their social and environmental performance. The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), launched at the New York Stock Exchange in April 2006, had after six months been accepted by 94 institutional investors from 17 countries representing US$5 trillion in investments.

Through the GEO-4 scenario exercise, stakeholders explored the interplay between some of the environmental issues in atmosphere, land, water and biodiversity.
The scenarios are based on assumptions related to institutional and socio-political effectiveness, demographics, economic demand, trade and markets, scientific and technological innovation, value-systems and social and individual choices, and highlighted those areas of uncertainty in the coming decades. The following are the main elements of the four scenarios:
■ Markets First: the private sector, with active government support, pursues maximum economic growth as the best path to improve the environment and human well-being for all.
■ Policy First: the government sector, with active private- and civic-sector support, implements strong policies intended to improve the environment and human wellbeing, while still emphasizing economic development.
■ Security First: the government sector and the private sector vie for control in efforts to improve, or at least maintain, human well-being for mainly the rich and powerful in society.
■ Sustainability First: the civic, government and private sectors work collaboratively to improve the environment and human well-being for all, with a strong emphasis on equity.
There is an increasing understanding of how the environmental changes being recorded around the world are linked through time and space via a complex set of biophysical and social processes. These changes may continue even if the forces of change are removed, as evidenced by the stratospheric ozone depletion and the loss of species.
Such time lags have implications for the formulation and implementation of policy interventions. Biophysical and social systems can also reach tipping points, beyond which there are abrupt, accelerating, or potentially irreversible changes. The four GEO-4 scenarios show an increasing risk of crossing tipping points, even as some global environmental degradation trends are slowed or reversed at different rates towards the middle of the century.



6 going forward
The pressing environmental issues facing decision-makers today can be mapped along a continuum from
those where proven solutions are available, to those where both the understanding of the problem and its solutions are still emerging. In all cases, science has a key role to play in providing the best available information to enable informed decision-making. The long-term knowledge base of indigenous peoples in providing such knowledge should also be considered.
Existing institutions are vital in creating the right conditions for change. Further achievements can be brought about by following a two-track, complementary approach (see Figure 14):
n Expanding institutions and adapting policies that have already worked effectively for conventional problems into areas lacking such policies, especially in developing regions, and financing this endeavour; Supporting innovation that pursues new and emerging solutions for persistent environmental problems by using economic instruments and more adaptive approaches.

Building on recent gains

Over the last 20 years, the range of institutions and policy options for dealing with environmental problems has expanded and diversified. Investing in results-based management of existing environmental institutions can help strengthen capacities for determining environmental risks and trade-offs, promoting timely action, reducing the costs of inaction and integrating environment with development. Table 2 summarizes a simple categorization of environmental policies, which have evolved over the last two decades from command-and-control regulations to the creation of markets.
Direct regulation still plays a major role and is likely to continue doing so, even if the use of market forces and soft instruments (such as providing information) play a more important role than before. An effective toolbox would include a wide variety of instruments, often used together, that are customized to specific institutional setups, as well as the prevailing social and cultural situations.

When a new approach works well - whether in forest management, irrigation techniques or the protection of threatened species - the lessons learned during the process can help establish what becomes a new standard for best practices in that sector. Even if these practices do not provide the whole solution to an environmental problem, they are important incremental steps along the way towards solutions. Experiences from global, regional, national and local initiatives that address complex environmental issues across sectors have also provided some valuable lessons on general principles for public policy formulation and implementation. To increase the chance of success, policy-makers may:
■ Stimulate political will, through public awareness, education, and conflict-mediation systems;
■ Create the necessary legislative basis and environmental judiciary, minimize delays between policy decisions and implementation, and ensure sustainable financing systems are safeguarded from corruption;
■ Strengthen and reinforce the capacity of agencies and staff operating at local, national and international level;
■ Decentralize power to the lowest level appropriate for the decision, where it is usually more timely and meaningful;
■ Involve relevant stakeholders, such as through formal or informal partnerships, and transfer authority to stakeholders who have a relative advantage, stake and competence in assuming the responsibility;
■ Support and facilitate the active participation of women, local communities and marginalized and vulnerable groups in decision making;
■ Support research, monitoring, and information networking and develop specific management objectives, selecting appropriate and measurable indicators, and monitoring and assessing progress against these objectives.

Strong organizations are crucial for effective implementation of public policy. Since 1987, there has been an overabundance of organizational arrangements, especially at the global level. Significant opportunities for increased effectiveness are offered by the UN reform process initiated by the 2005 World Summit. The process identified the need for more efficient environmental activities within the UN, and is consistent with the IEG initiative. Coordination within the UN can be enhanced through joint programming and practical cooperation between UN agencies, such as UNEP and UNDP, and within the ""One UN"" approach at the country level. Calls for a UN or World Environment Organization (UNEO or WEO) have been made since the early 1970s. There is still much debate about whether there is a need for such an organization, however, and what form it could take.

Better treaty compliance can be achieved by overcoming the material limitations for Parties to meet their obligations, including administrative costs and the heavy reporting burden. There are now more than 500 international treaties and other agreements related to the environment, of which 323 are regional, and 302 date from the period between 1972 and the early 2000s (see Figure 15 on ratification of MEAs). Improved monitoring and compliance mechanisms, such as the establishment of a voluntary peer-review mechanism on compliance, can also contribute. Identified interlinkages and synergies between environmental challenges can serve as areas for cooperation among the treaties and for more effective implementation and capacity building at the national level.
The integration of environmental activities into the broader development framework
is at the heart of the MDG on achieving environmental sustainability. Improved efficiency and coherence can be achieved by integrating environmental mitigation and adaptation efforts into development policies.
A key role for environmental institutions to achieve this goal is to provide knowledge and promote awareness; identify targets, policies, regulations, tools and best practices; and monitor long-term achievements.

Striving to ensure more sustainable patterns of consumption and production is a key approach to mainstreaming the environment. Opportunities exist in the implementation of the multi-stakeholder Marrakech process, which supports regional and national initiatives to promote the shift towards such patterns. Efforts to link environmental policies with major public budgets represent another effective option for integration. A relatively small number of countries, including Canada and Norway, for example, review their budgets to ascertain the environmental impacts of proposed public spending. The EU requires an environmental impact assessment for spending on national projects from structural and regional funds.

Strengthened environmental knowledge

about interactions between people and the environment at all scales, based on the best-available scientific research (see Figure 16) and data, can be achieved by improving knowledge infrastructure and capacities, promoting interoperability of data systems and tools, and information networking, particularly in developing regions. Effective implementation of the Bali Strategic Plan on Technology Support and Capacity Building, adopted in February 2005 by the UNEP Governing Council, will strengthen the capacity of states on environmental issues at all levels. It calls for a bottom-up approach in identifying specific objectives, strategies and activities that need support. It also stresses the importance of, and national ownership and South-South cooperation for assessing overall needs and setting priorities. Learning about best practices can be facilitated, for instance, through web- based learning platforms and networks. These incremental gains should not be forgotten in pursuing solutions to all pressing environmental problems at the same time.
There is considerable scope for mobilizing financial resources to address environmental problems. Building intergovernmental partnerships and implementing outcomes of the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development can provide much-needed support. There may also be environmental and economic benefits in phasing out some subsidies. For instance, an International Atomic Energy Agency study of energy subsidies in eight developing countries, mostly in Asia, concluded that their annual economic growth would increase by over 0.7 per cent, while their CO2 emissions would go down by nearly 1 6 per cent, if the subsidies were eliminated. Green budgeting, the creation of conservation funds and economic instruments, such as user fees and charges, are among the tools that have been applied in various countries. Financing plans that allow local resource conservation to pay for itself over time can be developed, but local communities or domestic financial sources are often unable to make the initial seed investment. Liberalization of trade in goods-and-services of interest to developing countries could generate additional financial flows totalling about US$310 billion yearly. Realizing this potential, however, will depend on success in achieving an open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, which benefits countries at all stages of development. It will also depend on meaningful trade liberalization which takes into account impacts on the environment, and which does not compromise effective management of the environment.

Reducing people's vulnerability to environmental and socio-economic changes is one component of protecting and extending recent gains. This can involve strengthening local rights by, for example, developing institutional forms that are more inclusive of local concerns or strengthening resource tenure to give people secure access to their livelihood assets and increased control over how local resources are used. Reducing vulnerability includes access to better financial and technical support and information, and investing in the capacity to cope with natural disasters and adapt to climate change. Empowering women not only contributes to the widely shared objective of equity and justice, but also makes good economic, environmental and social sense. Evidence shows that finance schemes that target women can have higher-than-usual payoffs and more sustainable outcomes. Better access to education improves maternal health, creating a better starting point for the next generation.

Innovations and emerging solutions

For many problems, the benefits from early and ambitious action outweigh the costs. Scenarios on future global environmental changes suggest that implementing determined action in the present is cheaper than waiting for better solutions to come along. Delayed action also unfairly shifts the burden of paying such costs onto future generations, contradicting the principle of inter-generational equity. In particular, recent IPCC reports about the costs of inaction on climate change have raised the alarm about the need for action, and suggest that immediate measures are affordable for many countries. Innovative approaches are needed for society to make the necessary transition to a sustainable, low- carbon economy.
A number of structural innovations could form the basis of a more ambitious global policy agenda to enable such a transition. Contemporary approaches are moving, for example, towards collective learning and adaptive management. Effective adaptive governance depends on leadership and bridging organizations. Leaders are imperative for establishing a vision, building trust, generating knowledge, initiating partnerships among relevant actors, managing conflicts, and mobilizing broad support for change. Bridging organizations are often at the interface of scientific knowledge and policy or of local experience and research and policy. They reduce the cost of collaboration significantly and often perform important conflict resolution functions.
Adaptive governance approaches are well placed to manage uncertainty and periods of change. The rising price of oil, for example, has led to increased interest in other energy sources. Broad-based energy policies may
 benefit from an integrated multisectoral approach that addresses both the need to maintain biodiversity and vital ecosystem services, and the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
Greater emphasis is also being placed on economic instruments (see Table 3 for different types of instruments and applications). Natural resources - compared to financial, material and human resources - are the foundation for much of the wealth of countries. Managing this natural resources portfolio to maximize its returns and benefits over time is good investment.
The policy options available to influence economic drivers include green taxes, the creation of markets for ecosystem services, and environmental accounting. Governments are beginning to gain experience in implementing these instruments, although typically only at relatively small scales. Learning by doing can help develop new policy approaches to move development decisions in a sustainable direction.
Used properly, economic instruments provide market corrections, promote production efficiency or cost minimization, and facilitate flexible responses to changing circumstances. They can help economic development to foster environmental protection and vice- versa. Economic instruments may provide signals concerning resource scarcity and environmental damage which, in turn, can trigger more-efficient resource use and waste minimization. Instruments such as green taxes can raise revenues that may be used to improve environmental quality or reduce income taxes for the poor. Table 3 provides some examples of various economic instruments being applied to different environmental sectors.

In ecological tax reform and tax shifting, taxes on energy use and the consumption of other resources are increased, and corresponding reductions are often made on income tax. Although this has encountered stiff resistance from vested interests, ecological tax reforms have proved to be a stimulus for innovation and new employment opportunities. When introduced gradually and in ways that are revenue-neutral and easy to administer, these reforms may encourage environmentally conscious consumption patterns without having significant negative social distribution effects. Certain instruments, such as carbon taxes, that have a potentially significant impact on industry and national competitiveness, have been used by some countries. To date, however, carbon taxes have been introduced in only 12 countries, and their diffusion has been very slow.

A relatively new approach o-called payments for environmental or ecosystem services (PES) attempts to address the overexploitation of ecosystems by paying the individuals and communities that secure the supply of ecosystem services; the beneficiaries must pay for the services themselves. Costa Rica, brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and other de\eloping countries have pioneered PES schemes for the preservation of freshwater ecosystems, forests and biodiversity. Many PES schemes have originated in developed countries, particularly in the US, where it is estimated that the government spends at least US$1.7 billion a year to induce farmers to protect land. While the conservation goals may be laudable, the trade-distorting nature of some agricultural subsidies also needs to be considered.
Three main markets are emerging for payments for ecosystem services:
■ Watershed management, which may include control of floods, erosion, access to nutrients, sedimentation and water quality, as veil as maintenance of aquatic habitats and dry season flows;
■ biodiversity protection, which includes eco-label led products, ecotourism and payments for conservation of wildlife habitat;
■ Carbon sequestration, in which, for example, international buyers pay to plant new trees to absorb carbon, offsetting carbon emissions elsewhere.

Indicative of the growing interest in market mechanisms, the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2006 witnessed a booming global carbon market worth over U$$ 10 billion, 10 times the value of the previous year and more than the value of the entire US wheat crop in 2005 (US$7.1 billion).

Market failures are, however, not necessarily solved solely through market solutions,
A combination of market-based mechanisms and regulatory structures is often needed. The cap-and-trade model, in the case
of carbon emissions, is an example of
a regulatory framework defining overall emission limits before a market for emission credits can be established.

 CONCLUSION

conclusion
The intertwined environmental and developmental challenges that Our Common Future warned about in 1987
still exist, as do the associated policy challenges. Knowledge of the interlinkages between environment and development, and the impacts on human well-being, gained in the past two decades, can be used effectively for the transition towards sustainable development. Concerns about the global environment may have reached a tipping point of their own, with the growing realization that for many problems, the benefits of early action outweigh the costs. Now is the time to pursue the transition towards sustainable development supported by well-governed, innovative and results-oriented institutions, which can effectively respond to environmental challenges, particularly persistent ones.

Emission Pathway
The trajectory of annual global greenhouse gas emissions over time.
Energy and Industry C02 Emissions
C02 emissions from the energy and industry sectors. These are often referred to in this report when describing emission reduction rates and negative emissions
Feasible Rates of Emission Reduction
The average annual rate of emission reductions assumed feasible given assumptions about technological development, economic costs, and/or sociopolitical factors.
Global (total) Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Emissions from all sectors and all greenhouse gases
Integrated Assessment Models
Models of climate change that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in formal integrated representations. As such they describe the full chain of climate change, including relevant linkages and feedbacks between socio-economic and biophysical processes.
Likely Chance

Overshoot Pathway
An emission pathway wherein a selected target (concentration or temperature) is exceeded for a period of time, but is eventually met.
Pledge
For the purpose of this report, pledges include Annex 1 targets and non-Annex 1 actions as included in Appendix 1 and Appendix II, respectively, to the Copenhagen Accord.
Scenario
A description of how the future may unfold based on 'if-then' propositions. A scenario in the context of this report consists typically of a representation of an initial socio-economic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables.
Strict Rules
Pledge cases in which the impact of ""lenient LULUCF credits"" (see definition above) and surplus emissions units are set to zero.
Stylized Pathways
These are results from carbon cycle and climate models that are designed to better understand the relationships between emissions and temperatures, but do not explicitly incorporate assumptions about technological, economic or socio-political feasibility of emission reductions.
Surplus Emission Units
After the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012), according to Article 3, paragraph 13, Parties holding emission units not required for compliance with their commitments are able to carry over these units for future use or sale. These are called ""surplus emission units"". There is also the possibility that new surplus emission units will be created in the second commitment period, when targets are set below business-as-usual expectations.
Temperature Limits
Targets for maximum global average temperature increase above pre-industrial levels.
20th-80th percentile range
Results that fall within the 20-80 per cent range of the frequency distribution of results in this assessment.

Technical Summary
The Emissions Gap Report
Are the Copenhagen Accord Pledges Sufficient to Limit Global Warming to 2* C or 1.5*C?
A Preliminary Assessment
The Copenhagen Accord declared that deep cut: in global emissions are required ""so as to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius"". The Accord called for an assessment that would consider strengthening the long-term goal including ""temperature rises of J,5 degrees"". Since December 2009 140 countries have associated themselves with the Copenhagen Accord. Of these, 85 countries have pledged to reduce their emissions or constrain their growth up to 2020,
The question remains, however, whether these pledges are sufficient to achieve	* COPlb • COPENHAGEN •
the Accord's temperature limits, or if there will be a gap between what is needed and what is expected as a result of the pledges.
Many scientific groups have identified global emission pathways2, or emissions trajectories, that are consistent with various temperature limits, while others have estimated global emissions in 2020 based on the Copenhagen Accord pledges. Some groups have calculated both. Not surprisingly, different groups have come up with different estimates. The range of estimates is caused, for example, by the fact that some of the pledges have conditions attached, such as the provision of finance and technology or ambitious action from other countries. This leads to a range of potential outcomes rather than a single estimate.
To understand and interpret the range of result: coming from different studies, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in conjunction with the European Climate Foundation and the National Institute of Ecology, Mexico, convened a six-month preliminary assessment of these studies. This assessment aims to provide policy-makers with an overview of result: from various studies, as well as their areas of agreement and disagreement. Individuals from twenty-five groups have contributed to the assessment and co-authored this publication. This report is a summary of that work.
Notably, the 2020 emissions reduction pledges analysed in this report were not decided under a quantitative top-down approach to emissions management — one that starts with temperature limit: for which the mitigation effort is distributed among countries by negotiation. Therefore, at this time we are only analysing the effect of the offers brought forward by countries in the form of pledges under the Copenhagen Accord,
 

9
This assessment addresses four main questions:
■ What 2020 emission levels are consistent with the 2°C and 1.5°C limits?
■ What are the expected global emissions in 2020?
■ How big is the""emissions gap""?
■ How can the gap be reduced?
 4 Although the Copenhagen Accord is not explicit about the baseline against which temperature increase shoud be measured, we have assumed that it is pre-industrial levels.

Key findings
- Studies show that emission levels of approximately 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtC02e) (range: 39-44 GtC02e*) in 2020 would be consistent with a ""likely"" chance of limiting global warming to2° C.
- Under business-as-usual projections, global emissions could reach 56 GtC02e (range: 54-60 GtC02e) in 2020, leaving a gap of 12 GtC02e.
- If the lowest-ambition pledges were implemented in a ""lenient"" fashion**, emissions could be lowered slightly to 53 GtC02e (range: 52-57 GtC02e), leaving a significant gap of 9 GtC02e.
- The gap could be reduced substantially by policy options being discussed in the negotiations:
> By countries moving to higher ambition, conditional pledges
> By the negotiations adopting rules that avoid a net increase in emissions from (a) ""lenient"" accounting of land use, land-use change and forestry activities and (b) the use of surplus emission units
- If the above policy options were to be implemented, emissions in 2020 could be lowered to 49 GtC02e (range: 47-51 GtC02e), reducing the size of the gap to 5 GtC02e. This is approximately equal to the annual global emissions from all the world's cars, buses and transport in 2005 - But this is also almost 60 per cent of the way towards reaching the2° C target.
- It will also be important to avoid increasing the gap by ""double counting"" of offsets.
- Studies show that it is feasible to bridge the remaining gap through more ambitious domestic actions, some of which could be supported by international climate finance.
- With or without a gap, current studies indicate that steep emission reductions are needed post 2020 in order to keep our chances of limiting warming to2° C or 1.5°C.
* Range here refers to the ""majority of results"" i.e. their 20th and 80th percentile.
** ""Lenient"" in this report is used to refer to the situation in which LULUCF accounting rules and the use of surplus emission units result in a net increase in emissions
Box 1 : Method for assessing emission levels consistent with temperature limits
In this assessment we examine two groups of pathways: (1) pathways produced by integrated assessment models (1AM), which simulate the energy-economic system including the turnover of energy infrastructure; and (2) ""stylized"" pathways, produced by other models that do not explicitly model the change in the energy system or feasibility of emission reduction rates. We focus on results from lAMs because they are able to actually describe the system's response to different policies and measures and emission-related targets (see Box 2). However, we also draw on ""stylized"" scenarios in order to better understand the theoretical rates of emission reduction and magnitude of negative emissions needed to be consistent with particular temperature limits.
A total of 223 emission pathways produced by 15 modelling groups have been analysed. We account for many, but not all, sources of the uncertainty of models and data by compiling results from a number of studies and identifying conclusions that appear robust.

What 2020 emission levels are consistent with the 2°C and 1 SX limits?
The level of human-induced global warming is primarily determined by the cumulative emissions over time, i.e. when emissions peak, at what level, and how fast they decline thereafter. 
The total stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has a strong effect on climate forcing related to climate change. Tit is stock is determined by the accumulated emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It follows that cumulative emissions have a profound influence on the long-term increase of global temperature6.
An important point is that several different emission pathways can result in the same cumulative emissions over a period of time. But nota II pathways are considered equally feasible; some are thought to be constrained by an upper ceiling on the rate of emission reductions due to technological, economic, social and political factors. Hence, the feasibility of reduction rates plays a central role in determining which 2020 emission levels are consistent with temperature limits. Also important are assumptions about the feasibility of ""negative emissions* i,e, the net removal of carbon dioxide iCO^} from the atmosphere through, for example, planting forests or capturing CO¿ from biomass {see Box3},
Studies show that there is a trade-off between the timing of the peak and the rate of decrease in emissions afterwards - tike sooner and lower the peak the slower the rate of decrease can be afterwards. Conversely, the longer tike peak is delayed and tike higher it is, tike faster emissions must decline afterwards, and/or tike stronger tike negative emissions over tike long term, in order to stay with in tike temperature limit (see Figure A},
Many recent modelling studies have assumed that it would be unrealistic for global emissions to immediately start decreasing (because of political and economic factors) and therefore have focused on scenarios in which global emissions continue to increase for a few years and then decrease sharply afterwards.

 THE EMISSIONS GAP REPORT - TECHNICAL SUMMARY 12
Box 2: Understanding temperature limits
A temperature increase of 2° C or 1.5° C represents an increase in global average near surface temperature compared with pre-industrial times. This is meant to be an indicator of local climate changes. Importantly, a 2° C or 1.5° C global average increase can translate into much higher temperature changes locally.
There are significant uncertainties in the relationship between temperature, emission pathways, cumulative emissions, and atmospheric concentrations. Therefore, in this assessment, each emission pathway is associated with a range of probabilities for temperature, reflecting uncertainties in the carbon cycle and many other aspects of the climate system. Hence, an emission pathway is associated with probabilities of staying within a range of different temperature changes.
To illustrate, an emission pathway that has a 50 per cent chance of limiting warming to under 2° C, may also have a 5 percent probability that warming will exceed 3°C and, say, a 10 percent probability of staying below 1.5° C. Similarly, an emission pathway that has a 66 per cent chance of staying under 2° C, may also have a probability of less than 3 per cent that warming will exceed 3° C and, say, a 20 per cent probability of staying below 1.5° C.
In this assessment we focus on emission pathways that lead to a global average temperature increase of less than 2° C over this century with a ""likely"" chance (greater than 66 per cent probability) and then explain how they would be different for a ""medium"" chance (50-66 per cent probability). In addition we examine pathways in which the temperature changes are below 1.5° C by the end of the century, but ""overshoots"" this value for part of the century.
 

2. Emission pathways consistent with a ""likely"" chance of meeting the 2° C limit generally peak before 2020, have emission levels in 2020 around 44 GtC02e (range: 39-44 GtC02e), have steep emission reductions afterwards and/or reach negative emissions in the longer term.
Emission pathways assessed in this report that provide a ""likely"" (greater than 66 per cent) chance of staying within the 2° C limit, have the following characteristics:
■ A peak in global annual emissions before 2020.
■ 2020	global	emission	levels of around 44 GtC02e
(range: 39-44 GtC02e).
■ 
Average annual reduction rates of C02 from energy and industry between 2020 and 2050 of around 3 per cent (range: 2.2 to 3.1 per cent).
■ 2050	global	emissions	that	are	50-60 per cent below
their 1990 levels.
■ In most cases, negative C02 emissions from energy and industry starting at some point in the second half of the century.
Accepting a ""medium"" (50-66 per cent) rather than ""likely"" chance of staying below the 2° C limit relaxes the constraints only slightly: emissions in 2020 could be 1 GtC02e higher, and average rates of reduction after 2020 could be 2.5 per cent per year (range 2.2-3.0 per cent). Nevertheless, global emissions still need to peak before 2020 in the majority of cases.
3. It turns out that the 2020 emission levels with a ""likely"" chance of staying within the 2° C limit can be about the same as those with a ""medium"" or lower chance of meeting the 1.5o C target. However, to have a higher chance of meeting the 1.5° C target the emission reduction rates after 2020 would have to be much faster.
In this assessment we have identified some emission pathways that keep the increase in temperature below 1.5°C by 2100, but ""overshoot"" this limit by a small amount for a few decades prior to 2100. However, the chance of doing so is low (range: 27-35 per cent probability). The emission levels in 2020 of these pathways are about the same as those in Point 2 above, i.e. they are consistent with a likely chance of staying below the 2° C limit throughout the twenty-first century.

Box 3. What are feasible emission reduction rates? What are negative emissions?
The behaviour of the climate system dictates that future temperatures will be strongly influenced by emissions throughout the coming decades. Hence, the consistency of 2020 emissions with a given temperature limit can only be judged if emissions after 2020 are taken into account. For that reason it is important to know the feasible rates of emission reductions after 2020. Feasibility refers to whether a particular emission pathway is considered achievable. It depends upon technical, economic, political and social constraints and the extent of mitigation policy. Some of these factors, in particular technological and economic feasibility, can be represented in models such as integrated assessment models (IAM). These include assumptions about the maximum feasible rate of introducing technology, maximum costs of technologies, feasibility of specific system configurations, and limits regarding behavioural changes. Another important factor determining the maximum emissions reduction rate is the typical lifetime of machinery and infrastructure. These lifetimes are important if mitigation strategies aim to avoid premature replacement of capital, which is often considered to be very expensive. Other factors, such as political or social attitudes, might also influence the rate of emission reductions, but they are usually not taken into account by lAMs.
There are different views about feasible emission reduction rates. The highest average rate of emission reductions over the next four to five decades found in the 1AM literature is around 3.5 per cent per year. This would imply a decarbonisation rate (the rate of decrease in emissions per unit of GDP) of more than 6 per cent per year. Historically (1969-2009), a decarbonisation rate of about 1% has been seen globally. However, it is important to note that expectations about feasibility can change with future developments in technology, attitudes, and economics.
One of many important elements related to the feasibility of emission pathways is negative emissions. Many of the scenarios compiled in this assessment show global negative carbon dioxide (C02) emissions (from energy and industry) from midcentury onwards in order to achieve the temperature limits examined here.
Global negative C02 emissions would occur if the removal of C02 from the atmosphere is greater than the emissions into it. This might be achievable through large-scale afforestation efforts, for example. Many models assume a large deployment of bioenergy combined with carbon-capture-and-storage (BECCS) technology in order to achieve negative emissions. The feasibility of large scale bioenergy systems is related to its sustainability, including the availability of sufficient land and water, its impact on biodiversity, and the productivity of biomass.
If negative C02 emissions at a significant scale are not possible, then the options for meeting the limits are substantially constrained.



What are the expected global emissions in 2020?
5. Global emissions in 2020 will depend on the pledges implemented and the rules surrounding them. On one hand, emissions in 2020 could be as low as 49 GtC02e (range: 47-51 GtC02e) when countries implement their conditional pledges with ""strict"" accounting rules. On the other hand, they could be as high as 53 GtC02e (range: 52-57 GtC02e) when countries implement unconditional pledges
with ""lenient"" accounting rules.
As a reference point, without pledges global greenhouse gas emissions may increase from 45 GtC02e in 2005 to around 56 GtC02e in 2020 (range: 54-60 GtC02e) according to business-as-usual projections. These results come from thirteen studies that have been reviewed in this assessment.
Results show that the pledges, if implemented, are expected to reduce global emissions in 2020 compared to business-as-usual projections. How much lower will depend on:
i. Whether countries implement their unconditional (lower ambition) or conditional (higher ambition) pledges. Conditions attached to the pledges include, for example, the provision of adequate climate finance and ambitious action from other countries.
ii. The extent to which accounting rules for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) can be used to weaken the mitigation targets of industrialized countries. This could occur if credit is given for LULUCF activities that would have happened in any case without further policy intervention.
iii. The extent to which surplus emissions units, particularly those that could be carried over from the current commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, are used to meet industrialized country targets.
For the purposes of this report, we have developed four cases that provide a range of plausible outcomes from the UNFCCC negotiations, each with different combinations of the factors mentioned above. We use the term ""lenient rules""to refer to cases in which countries maximise the use of surplus emission units and ""lenient LULUCF credits"", and thereby weaken mitigation targets. 

We use ""strict rules"" for the cases in which they do not.
Case 1 - ""Unconditional pledge, lenient rules"": If countries implement their unconditional pledges and are subject to ""lenient"" accounting rules (as explained in the paragraph above), global emissions are expected to be about 53 GtC02e in 2020 (range: 52-57 GtC02e), or about 3 GtC02e lower than business-as-usual projections.
Case 2 - ""Unconditional pledge, strict rules"": If countries implement their unconditional pledges and are subject to""strict""accounting rules (as explained in the paragraph above), global emissions are expected to drop to 52 GtC02e (range: 50-55 GtC02e).
Case 3 - ""Conditional pledge, lenient rules"": If countries implement their higher ambition, conditional pledges and are subject to ""lenient"" accounting rules, global emissions are expected to drop to 51 GtC02e (range: 49- 53 GtC02e)
Case 4 - ""Conditional pledge, strict rules"": If countries implement their higher ambition, conditional pledges, and are subject to ""strict"" accounting rules, global emissions are expected to drop to 49 GtC02e in 2020. (range: 47-51 GtC02e).
Thus, under the most ambitious outcome, the pledges could result in 2020 emissions that are 7 GtC02e lower than business-as-usual.
6. Emissions could be lower or higher than these estimates, as a result of other factors. Emissions could be higher if offsets were to be ""double- counted"" towards both industrialized and developing country pledges or if pledges were to be ineffectively implemented. Emissions could be lower as a result of international climate finance for further mitigation efforts, or if countries were to strengthen their pledges, or if domestic activities went beyond their pledges.
The estimates reflected in the four cases do not take into account all factors that could affect emissions in 2020.
Two factors could increase emissions and lessen the impact of the pledges. If industrialized countries were to use offsets to meet their targets, and the developing countries that supplied the offsets also counted them towards their pledges, then emissions would be higher than estimated in Point 5. This ""double counting"" of offsets could increase emissions in 2020 by up to 1.3
15
Box 4. What are the temperature implications of present pledges?
It is not possible to precisely answer the above question because the trend in temperature will strongly depend on the pathway of emissions after 2020. But results from integrated assessment models give us a hint at the range of pathways that could occur between 2020 and 2100. If we start at the level of emissions expected from the Copenhagen Accord pledges in 2020 and then follow the range of these pathways through to 2100, we find that they imply a temperature increase of between 2.5 to 5°C before the end of the century (see Figure 2). The lower bound is the case in which emissions are fairly stringently controlled after 2020, and the upper in which they are more weakly controlled. In other words, emission levels in 2020 implied by current pledges do not seem to be consistent with 2° C or 1.5° C temperature limits. To stay within these limits, emission levels would have to be lower in 2020 and then be followed by considerable reductions.
Figure B - Temperature increases associated with emission pathways and compared to the expected emissions from the pledges: Coloured bands show groups of 1AM emission pathways that have approximately the same ""likely"" avoided temperature increase in the twenty-first century. Specifically the coloured bands show the 20th to 80th percentile range of the 1AM pathways associated with those temperature increases.1 Superimposed on top of the pathways is the range of estimated emissions resulting from the Copenhagen Accord pledges. The small black bar shows the range of median estimates from the four pledge cases. The thin blue bar represents the wider range of estimates associated with those four cases (the 20th to 80th percentile range).





How big is the ""emissions gap""?
8. A ""gap"" is expected in 2020 between emission levels consistent with a 2° C limit and those resulting from the Copenhagen Accord pledges. The size of the gap depends on the likelihood of a particular temperature limit, and how the pledges are implemented. If the aim is to have a ""likely"" chance (greater than 66 per cent) of staying below the 2° C temperature limit, the gap would range from 5-9 GtC02e, depending on how the pledges are implemented.
As a reference point, we saw in Point 2 that to have a ""likely"" chance of staying below the 2° C temperature limit, global emissions should be around 44 GtC02e (range: 39-44 GtC02e). But according to business-as- usual projections global emissions in 2020 may be around 56 GtC02e (range: 54-60 GtC02e). This leaves a gap of about 12 GtC02e (range: 10-21 GtC02e).
The four pledge cases, each with different assumptions about the future outcome of the UNFCCC negotiations, result in different gaps as follows:
Case 1 - ""Unconditional pledges, lenient rules"". The gap would be reduced down to 9 GtC02e (range: 8-18 GtC02e) or about 3 GtC02e below business-as-usual.
Case 2 - ""Unconditional pledges, strict rules"". The gap would be about 8 GtC02e (range: 6-16 GtC02e), or about
4 GtC02e below business-as-usual.
Case 3 - ""Conditional pledges, lenient rules"". The gap would be about 7 GtC02e (range: 5-14 GtC02e) or about
5 GtC02e below business-as-usual.
Case 4 - ""Conditional pledges, strict rules"". The gap would be about 5 GtC02e (range: 3-12 GtC02e). This is about 7 GtC02e lower than business-as-usual, and almost 60 per cent of the way to the 2°C levels. Although the gap would



be considerably narrower than the business-as-usual case, it would still be as large as the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Union in 2005 or from global road transport emissions in that year.
These results can be seen in Figure C.
Double-counting of international emission offsets could also increase the gap up to 1.3 GtC02e. This is a real risk since the Copenhagen Accord does not include rules regarding the use of international offsets.
As a final point here, to have a ""medium"" rather than a ""likely"" chance of staying within the 2° C limit, global emissions in 2020 can be about 1 GtC02e higher and the gap also narrows by about 1 GtC02e.
9. There are considerable uncertainties around the estimates of the gap.
Since the emissions gap is the difference between emission levels for different temperature targets and expected emissions in 2020, the gap also inherits the uncertainties of these two components. The reader will note that the range around median estimates (Figure C) is not symmetric; the lower bound extends about 1-2 GtC02e below the median, whereas the upper bound rises 7-9 GtC02e above it (for a ""likely"" chance of staying below 2°C). One way to interpret this skewed range is that the gap may turn out to be higher rather than lower than the median.
This assessment focuses on the majority (20th - 80th percentile) of emission pathways. But there are obviously also results outside of this range. In the extreme case, if we combine the highest 2° C emission levels with the lowest estimate of expected emissions, the gap disappears. At the opposite extreme, if we combine the lowest 2°C emission levels with the highest estimate of expected emissions, the gap would be greater than 20 GtC02e.


















How can the gap be reduced?
10. Various international policy actions are available to close the gap.
a) Reducing the gap through higher ambition pledges.
The gap can be reduced by around 2-3 GtC02e (with a range of estimates from 2 to 5 GtC02e) by moving from the unconditional (lower ambition) pledges to the conditional (higher ambition) pledges.
— Industrialized countries: The majority of this reduction would come from industrialized countries, whose pledges are sometimes conditional on the ambitious action of other countries or on domestic legislation.
— Developing countries: A smaller, but still important, part of the reduction would come from developing countries, whose pledges are sometimes conditional on the adequate provision of international climate finance or technology transfer.
b) Reducing the gap by tightening the rules.
The gap can be reduced by around 1-2 GtC02e by ensuring that ""strict"" rules apply to the use of LULUCF credits and surplus emission units.
— LULUCF accounting:	If industrialized
countries apply ""strict"" accounting rules to minimise the use of what we refer to as'lenient LULUCF credits', they would strengthen the effect of their pledges and thus reduce the emissions gap by up to 0.8 GtC02e.
— Surplus emission units: Likewise, if the rules governing the use of surplus emission units under the Kyoto Protocol were designed in a way that would avoid the weakening of mitigation targets, the gap could be reduced by up to 2.3 GtC02e.These include units carried over from the current commitment period and any potential new surpluses created in the next.
We note that policy options (a) and (b) are interdependent and so their benefits cannot necessarily be added together. But we estimate that the two options combined could reduce emissions by around 4 GtC02e in 2020 (with a range of estimates of 4-6 GtC02e) compared with the least ambitious case (case 1).

In addition, the risk of the gap increasing in size can be avoided if the negotiations set rules regarding international offsets to prevent them from being counted towards both industrialized and developing country pledges. ""Double-counting"" would increase the gap by up to 1.3 GtC02e.
11. It is feasible to close the remaining gap through further mitigation actions by countries, some of which could be supported by international climate finance.
If the above measures were to be taken, there might still be a gap of 5 GtC02e compared with a 2° C limit. This gap could be closed if countries were to adopt more ambitious actions or pledges. The results from integrated assessment models (1AM) suggest that it is possible to reach emission levels where there is no gap, using mitigation measures that are economically and technologically feasible..
Analysis also shows that international climate finance in line with the Copenhagen Accord could help achieve some of these reductions in developing countries.
12. Studies show that laying the groundwork for steep rates of emissions reduction from 2020 onwards would be necessary for staying within a limit of 2° C and even more so for 1.5° C, whatever the outcome of the pledges.
The results of the 1AM pathways that have a ""likely"" (greater than 66 per cent) or even ""medium"" (50-66 per cent) chance of limiting temperature increase to 2° C show average annual emission reduction rates of greater than 2 per cent per year after 2020. Achieving this over the long-term would be unprecedented because, on the contrary, global emissions have almost continuously grown since the industrial revolution.
The higher the emissions in 2020, the faster the rate of decline required thereafter to meet temperature targets. Therefore, if targets are to be met, it will be essential to lay the groundwork now for such rates of reduction. This can be done, for example, by avoiding lock-in of high carbon infrastructure with long life-spans and developing and introducing advanced clean technologies.
1. Introduction
L1.1. COPENHAGEN, TEMPERATURE LIMITS AND PLEDGES
Following the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, forty-two industrialized countries submitted quantified economy-wide emission targets for 2020. In addition, forty-three developing countries submitted nationally appropriate mitigation actions for inclusion in the Appendices to the 2009 Copenhagen Accord. These pledges have since become the basis for analysing the extent to which the global community is on track to meet long-term temperature goals as outlined in the Copenhagen Accord:
(Para 1)...To achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, we shall', recognizing the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2

degrees Celsius; on the basis of equity and in the context of sustainable development; enhance our long-term cooperative action to combat climate change.
(Para 2)...We agree that deep cuts in global emissions are required according to science; and as documented by the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report with a view to reduce global emissions so as to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius; and take action to meet this objective consistent with science and on the basis of equity.
(Para 12)...We call for an assessment of the implementation of this Accord to be completed by 2015, including in the light of the Convention's ultimate objective. This would include consideration of strengthening the long-term goal referencing various matters presented by the science, including in relation to temperature rises of 1.5 degrees Celsius.
This publication aims to assess the following questions: are countries' pledges of action collectively consistent with and, if implemented, likely to achieve the 2° C and 1.5° C temperature goals? If not, how big is the gap between emission levels consistent with these temperature goals and the emissions expected as a result of the pledges?
Notably, the 2020 emission reduction pledges were not decided through a quantitative top-down approach to emissions management, i.e. one that would begin with agreed-upon temperature limits and then be followed by negotiation to distribute the burden of emission reductions necessary to meet these limits. Therefore, at this time we can only analyse the emerging ""global deal"" on climate change by summing pledges from the bottom up—in other words, based on offers already brought forward voluntarily by countries.



Box la: Understanding temperature limits
A warming limit of 2° C or 1.5° C refers to the increase in global annual average near surface temperature compared with pre-industrial times. This temperature is intended to be an indicator for local changes in a wide range of observable quantities, such as precipitation. It is important to note that a 2° C global average rise can translate into much larger (or smaller) temperature changes in different latitudes and elevations. Moreover, undesirable impacts will generally be driven by local climate changes (e.g. changes in rainfall patterns) and often by changes in extremes in different seasons rather than by annual average temperature values.
There are significant uncertainties in the relationship between temperature, emission pathways, cumulative emissions, and atmospheric concentrations. Therefore, in this assessment, each emission pathway is associated with probabilities of staying within a range of temperature limits. These probabilities reflect the uncertainties in the carbon cycle as well as many other aspects of the climate system. To illustrate, an emission pathway that has a 50 per cent chance of limiting warming to under 2° C may also have a 5 per cent probability that warming will exceed 3° C and, say, a 10 per cent probability of staying below 1.5° C. If we then considering emission pathway that has a 66 percent chance of being under 2° C, it may also have a probability of less than 3 per cent that warming will exceed 3° C, and, say, a 20 per cent probability of staying below 1.5° C.
Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee that a particular emission pathway will achieve a temperature limit of 2° C or 1.5° C, and probabilities of achievement are used instead. In this assessment we focus on two temperature limits, 2° C and 1.5° C; and two probabilities of meeting them - a ""likely""chance (probability greater than 66 per cent) and a ""medium""chance (probability between 50-66 per cent).

1.2. SCOPE OF THE REPORT
This report addresses many of the key issues raised by the Copenhagen Accord. For example, the emission pathways consistent with temperature limits and the expected emissions in 2020 based on current pledges. Furthermore, it examines whether there is a gap between emission levels consistent with temperature limits and expected emissions, and furthermore, the increases in temperature consistent with such a gap in emissions. Outside the scope of the report are issues related to the comparability and equity of pledges.
1.3. A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CHALLENGE
In assessing these issues we are confronted with a series of highly complex issues, which result from both scientific and political factors.
In Chapter 2, we focus on the likelihood of various emission pathways staying within temperature limits. For these pathways we identify the period in which emissions peak, the level of emissions in 2020, and the corresponding emission reduction rates after 2020. Results include emission pathways from integrated assessment models (1AM) and carbon cycle and climate models. Also discussed are current views about the feasibility of emission reductions and negative emissions, as well as factors determining long-term temperature, including cumulative emissions.
Chapter 3 reviews estimates of global emission levels in 2020 based on country emission pledges. Among the factors influencing these estimates are whether pledges are independent of, or conditional on, other countries' actions, financing or technological support. For industrialized countries, key factors include: the accounting procedures for emissions or uptake of carbon from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); the potential for international climate

finance, as agreed in the Copenhagen Accord to enable further emission reductions; the carry-over of emission reduction units from the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012); and the potential double counting of offsets with emission reductions from non- Annex I countries' actions. Emission estimates are also influenced by the uncertainty of base year emissions and by assumptions needed for filling in sectoral or other gaps in the emission estimates of various groups.
The pledges of industrialized countries are fairly easy to convert into emission estimates because they are usually related to historic emissions. However, more assumptions are needed to make this conversion for developing countries because their pledges have usually been pegged to economic, demographic or other projections.
Chapter 4 builds upon the previous two chapters by examining a possible ""emissions gap"" in 2020 between emission levels consistent with temperature limits and expected emissions resulting from the pledges. It then goes on to explore policy options for narrowing the size of the gap.
Chapter 5 goes a step further by reporting on possible long-term temperature changes following from current pledges.
The online version of the report contains three appendices with additional information about emission pledge calculations in this report. Appendix 1 provides detail on the differences between the four pledge cases described in Chapter 3 and the uncertainties around them. Appendix 2 provides a country-by-country analysis of the pledges of the largest emitting countries. Appendix 3 compares the findings of modelling groups that have assessed country pledges.
2.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter identifies future emission pathways that are consistent with a 2° C or 1,5° C temperature limit Many scenarios and pathways for annual global emissions of greenhouse gases have been published in the scientific literature to explore possible long-term trends in climate change. This literature has been used in this report to understand the kind of pathways consistent with the goal of limiting global temperature increase to less than 2°C or 15° C above pre-industrial levels.
Among the different studies of future emission pathways, two main types can be identified. The first type is produced by integrated assessment models {1AM), which simulate both future climate and future socio-economic systems, including the emissions of greenhouse gases from industry and power generation, agriculture, forestry and other land use activities {see for example Clarke et al, 2009, Edenhofer et al, 2010, van Vuuren et al, 2007), lAMs take into account assumptions about technological and economic constraints and so, to some extent, provide a view on what are ""feasible* emission reductions. The second type of pathway, described here as ""stylized* explores more directly the relationship between emissions and temperature, for example by making assumptions about the timing and magnitude of peak emissions and rates of reduction



2.2 WHAT DETERMINES LONG-TERM TEMPERATURE?
Many greenhouse gases emitted by human activities have long atmospheric residence times and alter the Earth's energy balance. In addition, the average temperature of the Earth typically adjusts only slowly to changes in the energy balance (Lowe et al. 2009, Solomon et al. 2009). These slow-change processes imply that decision makers need to take into account long-term effects of current and near term emissions (National Research Council 2009). This is even more important as many impacts of climate change are potentially adverse and/or irreversible (at least on time scales of relevance to society).
A number of recent studies have shown that one of the strongest predictors of temperature increase within the twenty-first century is the cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases, especially C02 (Allen et al. 2009, IPCC 2007b, Matthews and Caldeira 2008, Matthews et al. 2009, Meinshausen et al. 2009, Van Vuuren et al. 2008). Cumulative emissions are determined by the annual emissions over time. In ambitious mitigation scenarios, the following factors play an important role in determining the cumulative emissions:
• the year in which global emissions peak
• the emission level at the peak
• the pathway of global annual emissions after the peak.
For the same cumulative emissions, a higher and/or later emissions peak means faster reductions after the peak than for earlier and/or lower peaks in emissions.
However, all three factors are bounded by feasibility considerations, including economic and/or technological constraints (see Section 2.3). For instance, there are constraints on how fast high-carbon energy infrastructure can be replaced with low-carbon infrastructure (for example, coal-fired power plants with renewable energy production).
As a consequence, there is a limited range of 2020 emissions that are consistent with a 2° C or 1.5° C limit, given current assumptions about the feasibility of emission pathways post 2020.
In addition, the probability of exceeding a particular temperature level varies according to the cumulative emissions level—for a higher degree of confidence in staying within a particular temperature limit, a lower cumulative emissions level is required. Pathways with later or higher peaks also reduce, or even eliminate, the ""margin of error"", should future advances in climate science or additional evidence of the risks of climate change convince citizens and policymakers that more ambitious targets for limiting climate change are needed (Lowe et al. 2009).
2.3 CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FEASIBILITY
The implications of 2020 emission levels for long term temperature outcomes depend importantly on how much and how fast it is considered feasible to reduce emissions before, and particularly beyond 2020. Feasibility (i.e. considerations on whether a particular emission pathway is possible to achieve) is a subjective concept that has to take into account several factors: technological, economic, political and social. Technological feasibility refers to whether technologies exist, and can be scaled-up fast enough, to produce enough low-carbon energy to meet demand. Economic feasibility refers to whether or not the cost of doing so is considered prohibitively high. Political feasibility includes factors, such as whether the assumed extent of participation in emission reduction efforts across countries (or economic sectors) is plausible and whether the time required to develop institutions that would facilitate this participation is reasonable. Finally, social feasibility refers to whether measures to control emissions would be acceptable to society, for example after taking into account their implications for equity or for non-climate environmental consequences.
lAMs can account for several of these factors by representing inertia of technological and social systems. Examples include assumptions about the maximum feasible technology penetration rates, maximum cost, feasibility of specific system configurations, and maximum speed of behavioural changes.
The results of lAMs are, therefore, helpful in informing our view on feasibility and, hence, are the primary source of quantitative information used in this assessment. However, it should be noted that they do not set ""hard laws"" on feasibility. On the one hand, they are based on our current understanding of technological and economic constraints, which could change; therefore the range of emission pathways considered feasible could shrink or expand over time. For instance, the models do not include the possibility of the development of ""game-changing"" new technologies currently unforeseen. On the other hand, feasibility also depends on societal and political factors that are not typically considered in lAMs (Bosetti et al. 2010, Ha-Duong et al. 1997, Ha-Duong and Treich 2004). Recently, 1AM studies have explored the influence of participation of different countries in model comparison studies (Clarke et al. 2009) and this could reduce the range of pathways considered feasible.
One important factor determining the maximum emission reduction rate is the lifetime of machinery and infrastructure: this can be decades or even centuries for building stock and urban infrastructure; around 40 years for power stations; 20 to 40 years for manufacturing equipment; up to 20 years for heating devices; and 10 to 20 years for passenger vehicles, but much longer for transport infrastructure (Philibert 2007). These lifetimes are critically important, if mitigation strategies aim to avoid premature replacement of capital and the high costs associated with it. For illustration, carbon dioxide emissions from energy and industry would decline by about 3 per cent per year if no new emission-producing infrastructure were to be built (adapted from Davis et al. 2010). In the assessed 1AM literature on mitigation scenarios, the highest average rate of total emission reduction over the next 4 to 5 decades is about 3.5 per cent per year (den Elzen et al. 2010).
To put this in context, a global C02 emission reduction rate of 3 per cent would require a rate of decrease in emissions per unit of GDP (or decarbonization rate) of almost 6 per cent for an assumed annual rate of global GDP growth of 3 per cent. Ranger et al. (2010) show that there is very little precedent for such high rates of emission reductions amongst the top 25 emitters. The global decarbonization rate over the 1969-2009 period was 1 per cent on average, although this was in the absence of strong international climate policies. In a society that places the highest possible priority on reducing emissions, the normal capital turnover rate could possibly be increased. However, some studies suggest that higher annual reduction rates of up to about 6 percent per year are possible for a limited time in certain circumstances, but only when the conditions have been put in place for rapid investment in decarbonization of the energy sector (e.g. Edenhofer et al. 2009). The feasibility of achieving emission reduction rates of 3 per cent or more per year for C02 emissions from energy and industry is highly uncertain, given political and societal constraints and the fact that emission reductions are not likely to be distributed evenly across nations.
Lastly, it should be noted that most of the pathways consistent with the temperature limits in this report include negative global emissions of C02 from energy and industry beginning in the 2060s and 2070s. Understanding the feasibility of negative emissions is therefore crucial for assessing the chances of meeting the 2° C and 1.5° C temperature limits: if negative emissions of a significant scale are not possible, then our options for meeting the targets are significantly constrained. Global net negative emissions occur when the removal of C02 from the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities is greater than the anthropogenic emissions into it. One way to achieve this (and assumed by many lAMs) is through the implementation of bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). This involves using large amounts of biomass to generate energy, and then capturing and safely storing underground or elsewhere C02 released by combustion. Since biomass takes up C02 from the atmosphere in the course of its growth, and since the C02 taken up is stored underground, BECCS in effect removes C02 from the atmosphere (Azar et al. 2010). Direct air capture of C02 and other technologies may also lead to negative emissions, but are currently not included in lAMs. The feasibility of large scale bioenergy systems, whether used in conjunction with CCS or not, is related to factors such as availability of land and water, impacts on biodiversity, and biomass productivity.
2.4 WHAT EMISSION PATHWAYS AND EMISSION LEVELS IN 2020 ARE CONSISTENT WITH 2° C AND 1.5° C LIMITS?
This section explains how the re-analysed 1AM pathways relate to 2020 emission levels, and how these levels relate to the subsequent evolution of pathways that are consistent with the 2° C and 1.5° C temperature limits. Findings from ""stylized"" pathways are also discussed, because they add to our understanding of emission pathways consistent with temperature limits. It is shown that expected levels of global emissions in 2020 carry important information for policymakers about the feasibility, scale and magnitude of actions required afterwards to limit global temperature increase.




























Box 2a: Method for identifying emission pathways
For the purpose of this assessment we collected a total of 223 emission pathways. Of these 126 were 1AM emission pathways published by 15 modelling groups, of which 113 explored low greenhouse gas concentration targets while taking into account some assumptions about technological and socio-economic inertia, whereas the remaining 13 represent scenarios without strong mitigation policy. These 1AM pathways had varied rates of emission reductions across regions, sectors and gases in order to minimise costs. Of the 223 pathways, 97 were ""stylized"" pathways which did not make assumptions about technological and economic feasibility, but identified the emission pathways that corresponded to particular temperature targets based on carbon cycle and climate models.
We have evaluated the probability of each of the pathways meeting a 2°C and 1.5° C limit. In order to make results more comparable, we have adjusted the pathways so that they have the same emission levels in 2000 and 2005. Emissions for these years were taken from the multi-gas emissions inventory developed as part of the ""Representative Concentration Pathways"" (RCPs) scenario exercise (Granier et al. submitted, Meinshausen et al. submitted). When a particular pathway lacked the emissions of a particular substance (e.g. sulphate aerosols, organic carbon, black carbon or atmospheric ozone precursors), these data were taken from the RCP3-PD scenario (van Vuuren et al. submitted). It should be noted that the RCP-3PD scenario assumes strong environmental policies and this is consistent with the aim of this report to identify mitigation pathways that stay within a 2° C or 1.5° C limit. Ozone depleting substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol are assumed to follow a gradual phase-out during the twenty-first century.
The temperature calculations of the harmonised emission pathways were made more comparable by using a single model MAGICC 6.3 (Meinshausen et al. 2009, Meinshausen et al. 2008) to calculate the probabilistic temperature outcome up to 2100 for each emission pathway.
A joint probability distribution of the most important climate response uncertainties has been used, with climate sensitivity uncertainties closely reflecting the estimate provided by the IPCC (IPCC 2007c).This distribution gives the probability of a particular response of temperature to emissions. Because a probability distribution rather than a single number is used for the climate sensitivity factor, temperature outcomes are expressed in terms of probabilities, for example, ""emission pathways with a medium chance of staying below a 2° C limit"". The emission pathways were put into different categories according to temperature limits (1.5° and 2° C), their probability of meeting the limit (50-66 per cent, greater than 66 per cent), the assumed technologies (e.g. negative emissions or not), and whether they are ""stylized"" or 1AM pathways.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis by analysing 11 recalibrated versions of the climate model to explore alternative values of the climate sensitivity distribution that have been published (see Meinshausen et al. 2009). For emission pathways that give around a ""medium"" chance of meeting a 2° C limit during the twenty-first century, the sensitivity studies lead to a spread in the median projected temperature of only ±0.2° C.
It is important to note that although we have harmonised the pathways for comparability, some uncertainties remain, for example, about future levels of anthropogenic aerosols, soot and organic carbon.
The climate model used in this study has previously been validated and shown to credibly reproduce observed climate changes when driven by historic emissions or forcings. However, like other climate models it does not include all of the physical processes that could affect the real climate in future. For instance, there is no treatment of extra carbon release from melting permafrosts.
Our quantitative assessment of 1AM pathways found a notable number and range of emissions that are consistent with the temperature limits of interest in this report, even after re-analysis. In the text we focus on the median and range of the ""majority of results"", with the range corresponding to the 20th to 80th percentile of outcomes. Results at either end of this range are not necessarily invalid or incorrect, and are also discussed in the text.
Assessment of the pathways consistent with 2° C
Of all 1AM emission pathways that were included in our quantitative assessment, 9 were found to have a ""likely"" chance (greater than 66 per cent) of limiting warming to less than 2° C above pre-industrial levels. The results of our quantitative assessment (Table 1) show that the majority of emission pathways with a ""likely"" chance of meeting the 2° C limit show the following characteristics:
• A peak in global greenhouse gas emissions before 2020 and in general earlier in the decade;
• 2020 global greenhouse gas emission levels of 44 GtC02e (median), with a range of 39-44 GtC02e;
• Average annual reduction rates of C02 emissions from energy and industry between 2020 and 2050 of around 3 per cent (range of 2.2-3.1 per cent)
• 2050 global emissions that are 50-60 per cent below their 1990 levels; and
• In most cases, negative C02 emissions from energy and industry beginning in the 2060s to 2070s.
A further 18 1AM pathways were found to have a ""medium"" chance (50-66 per cent) of staying below a temperature increase of 2° C. The 2020 emission levels are similar (median 45 GtC02e, range 42-46), while the emission reduction rate between 2020 and 2050 is lower (2.5 compared with 3 per cent per year). Half of these ""medium"" chance pathways involve net negative C02 emissions from energy and industry, beginning between the mid-2050s and mid-2070s.
In general, ""medium"" chance pathways for 2° C differ from ""likely"" chance pathways either by having higher emission levels in 2020 but the same rates of emission reductions afterwards, or having the same emission levels in 2020 but slower reduction rates afterwards. ""Likely"" chance pathways also rely more often on negative emissions.

The re-analysed set of ""styIized ""pathways (not included in Table 1) shows that, if emissions ranged up to 50 GtC02e in 2020, average reduction rates of up to 4 per cent per year would be needed in the 2020-2050 period to meet the 2° C limit (Rogelj et al. 2010b, Schaeffer and Hare 2009). The high end of these reduction rates is currently not found in the 1AM literature. These pathways also require large negative emissions in the second half of this century to meet the temperature limit.
Another important message from analysing 1AM emission pathways is that they suggest that it is economically and technologically feasible to achieve substantial emission reductions. This implies that it is possible to reach emission levels consistent with a 2° C target (i.e. approximately 44 GtC02e in 2020).
To have a higher confidence of staying below a 2° C limit, it seems essential to deploy negative emission technologies (to reduce C02 from energy and industry) in the second half of the century, that is, unless emission levels are significantly below 44 GtC02e in 2020.
Assessment of the pathways consistent with 1.5° C
None of the 1AM or ""stylized"" pathways in this assessment lead to temperature increases below 1.5° C throughout this century. One 1AM study published by Magné et al. (2010) depicts an emission pathway with a ""medium"" chance of achieving the 1.5° C target by the end of the century and has 2020 emissions of 41 GtC02e. These results suggest that after a small (0.1° C) transient overshoot of the temperature limit of about half a century, the temperature increase by the end of the twenty-first century could be brought back to below 1.5° C with a ""medium"" chance. In general, the 1AM pathways that meet the 2° C limit with a ""likely"" chance also meet the 1.5° C target by 2100 but with a lower probability of 30 per cent (range 27-35 per cent for the 20th-80th percentile) and with a median temperature peak at some point in the twenty-first century of between 1.6° C and 1.7° C.
A few studies have used stylized pathways to explore the achievement of a 1.5° C limit in more detail (Ranger et al. 2010, Schaeffer and Hare 2009). The stylized pathways included in this assessment suggest that limiting warming to 1.5° C by 2100 (with a ""medium"" to ""likely"" chance) means 2020 emission levels of 40 to 48 GtC02e (20th-80th percentile range), and reduction rates of 3 to 5 per cent per year in the 2020-2050 period (Schaeffer and Hare 2009). These pathways would also employ negative C02 emissions in the second half of this century. As discussed in Section 3, the feasibility of achieving such high emission reduction rates is difficult to assess and they are not found in the current literature of I AM results.
Results from low and high ends of emissions range in 2020
In the text we have focused on the ""majority of results""of the re-analysed 1AM pathway set (the median and 20th to 80th percentile range). However, results outside this range are also valid and provide useful information.
We first consider the high end of the range of expected emissions in 2020 represented by results from van Vuuren et al. 2007 for a ""likely"" chance to stay below a 2°C limit, and O'Neill et al. 2009 for a ""medium"" chance. At this end of the range emissions are 48 GtC02e. For a ""likely"" chance to achieve the temperature target, average reduction rates between 2020 and 2050 (of C02 emissions from energy and industry) are 3.2 per cent per year, and for a medium chance 3.6 per cent per year2. These set the upper range of emissions and reduction rates.
The low end of the range shows that relatively low emission reduction rates between 2020 and 2050 are sufficient to reach the temperature limit, if 2020 emission levels are at the low end of the range. Some pathways, for example in Barker and Scrieciu (2010) and Clarke et al. (2009), indicate 2020 emission levels of 26-36 GtC02e. These results suggest that it may be technologically and economically feasible to reduce global emissions by 2020 by substantially more than the majority of 1AM pathways assume.
 
Box 2b. Overshooting of 2° C Temperature limits
Model results show that temperature trends could overshoot and then drop again below temperature limits as a result of natural sinks"" acting to gradually reduce the atmospheric burden of the greenhouse gases over time. However, since this process occurs slowly, it is expected that once temperatures overshoot a target, they will take decades to drop below the target (Lowe et al. 2009). This process could be accelerated if negative C02 emissions were achieved as discussed earlier (Azar et al. 2006, Azar et al. 2010).
Overshoot pathways often arise in three different contexts: (1) deliberate policy choice to minimise mitigation costs; (2) failure to meet certain emission targets or goals; or (3) late participation by all major emitters in global mitigation efforts (Clarke et al. 2009, van Vliet et al. 2009). While deliberate overshoot may minimise mitigation costs over time, it does run the risk of lock-in of further fossil fuel use and thereby limiting the rate at which emissions can decline in subsequent years.
In the assessed 1AM pathway set, four pathways have a temporary temperature overshoot before dropping below 2° C again.3 All of these pathways have global negative C02 emissions to help achieve the target. In these pathways the constraint on 2020 emissions is relaxed slightly, and the peak is postponed to 2020 and beyond.
Delayed action may have economic benefits (as noted above), but also has risks associated with the higher, albeit temporary, temperatures. These include higher mitigation costs over the long term and later and larger damages from climate change impacts. Huntingford and Lowe (2007) argue that there are significant risks from exceeding temperature limits during overshoot scenarios, due to uncertainty about so-called tipping points. An additional risk of overshooting temperature limits is that positive feedbacks, not known in advance, might result in a larger temperature increase than anticipated.




2.5 GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE AND FURTHER WORK
The ability to assess pathways consistent with specific temperature limits depends on understanding both the climate system and the global energy system, as well as the ways in which each responds to change over time.
Important uncertainties exist in our understanding of the climate system. We have accounted for some of this uncertainty by examining the probability of meeting particular temperature limits. Future shifts in the underlying probability distributions, as a result of improved understanding of parameters and/or feedbacks in the climate system, could change the expected probability with which a certain pathway would meet a specified temperature limit. There is also much uncertainty around the issue of how rapidly temperatures may be reduced after overshooting, and the reversibility of associated climate system changes.
Our understanding of the feasibility of pathways is also incomplete. Many of the pathways assessed here were not designed to specifically investigate the limits to feasible emission reductions, and none of the studies were designed explicitly to explore the full range of emissions in 2020 that would be consistent with long-term temperature limits. Research specifically targeted to address these questions would improve our understanding of which pathways can feasibly achieve temperature targets.
In addition, emission pathways now considered infeasible could become feasible if variables such as population growth rate, consumption of energy, aerosol emissions, economic growth and technological developments turn out to be different from the assumptions used in current studies. Other factors could also make emission pathways feasible such as the willingness of society to take ""extreme"" action by retiring energy infrastructure before the end of its useful lifetime, or by making significant lifestyle changes. Similarly, the pathways thought to be feasible in this report could in practice be unachievable, if, for example, participation in mitigation efforts was limited across sectors and countries, or if technological and socio-economic barriers were more severe than expected.
Given these uncertainties, it will be crucial over time to re-evaluate the emission pathways consistent with particular temperature limits and to inform the policy community accordingly.

 
3. What are the expected global emissions in 2020?
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Nearly 140 countries have associated themselves with the Copenhagen Accord and 80 countries, representing about 80 per cent of global emissions, have appended targets (Annex I countries) and/or mitigation actions (non-Annex I countries). The aim of this chapter is to assess the published analyses and to explore what these targets and actions (collectively referred to as ""pledges"") are likely to lead to in terms of 2020 emissions. Three appendices to this Chapter are available online. Appendix 1 provides detail on the differences between the four cases and the uncertainties around them. Appendix 2 provides a country-by-country analysis of the pledges of the largest emitting countries. Appendix 3 compares the modelling groups' findings and details the adjustments made to their data to ensure consistent comparisons. Chapter 4 then goes on to combine these results with those of the previous chapter on emission pathways in order to assess the extent to which these pledges are consistent with a 2° C or 1.5° C pathway.
Estimating 2020 emissions, based on countries' pledges or submissions to the Copenhagen Accord, is not a simple task. This Chapter explains in detail that it involves inter alia: information on the historical, current and future growth of countries' emissions; interpretations in the cases in which countries have submitted a range of pledges; assumptions on the precise meaning of those pledges where countries have not been specific; and uncertainties in the underlying data used by modelling groups.
Therefore, we separate the emission estimates that are driven by distinct policy choices, either nationally or in the negotiations, from what is driven by different modelling assumptions. We first present the results of this analysis and then move on to explore the modelling uncertainties around them.
3.2 GLOBAL AGGREGATE EMISSIONS RESULTING FROM THE PLEDGES
For this assessment, the analyses of 13 modelling groups have been reviewed. Of these, nine groups have performed a global analysis and four have focused on either Annex I or a subset of other countries. These groups have made different assumptions about how the conditionality of pledges plays out in global emissions. Hence, adjustments have been made to the various estimates, in order to facilitate a meaningful comparison. The adjustments made are briefly explained in Box 3a and detailed in the appendices available online. The aim has been to construct a set of pledge cases with estimates of different 2020 emission levels.

Box 3a: Explanation of the four pledge cases and calculation method
In this chapter we have constructed four distinct pledge cases that could result from different policy choices of Governments or from different outcomes of the negotiations. These four cases are combinations of the following two interdependent factors:
Unconditional versus conditional pledges: We have distinguished between countries' unconditional and conditional pledges. Several industrialized countries have made pledges conditional on actions from other countries or the passing of domestic legislation, and developing countries' pledges are often conditional on finance or technology transfer. We have made common assumptions as to whether a country's pledge is deemed conditional or not (detailed in Appendix 2) and applied that to all modelling groups' estimates. We have then summed the estimates to create a global total, which also includes international transport emissions. Note that where a country does not have an unconditional pledge (e.g. Canada, Japan, US and South Africa) the business- as-usual estimate for that country is assumed for the unconditional case reflected in Figure 2.
""Lenient"" versus ""strict"" rules: We have adjusted these results to take into account the maximum impact of two unresolved issues in the negotiations: LULUCF accounting and the use of surplus emissions units. These issues have the potential to displace mitigation action in other sectors and thus lead to higher global emissions in 2020. The adjustments made are based on a review of existing literature and are reflected in the two ""lenient"" pledge cases (the ""strict rules"" cases do not include any impact from these issues). Specifically, for LULUCF accounting we have applied a maximum expected impact of 4.2 per cent of 1990 Annex I emissions annually in 2020 (approximately 0.8 GtC02e). We assumed that credits of this magnitude would be given for carbon removals from existing forests or other sinks that would have occurred without further policy interventions (see Box 3b). For surplus emissions units, we have made two adjustments: the first for the expected impact of surplus emissions units ""carried over"" or ""banked"" from the first commitment period and used in the next. We have applied the maximum expected impact of 1.3 GtC02e on 2020 emissions. The second adjustment is to account for any new surplus units that are expected to be generated in the next commitment period as a result of the pledges from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus remaining above business-as-usual. The expected impact of these depends on the modelling assumptions of each group and ranges up to 1 GtC02e in 2020.43 A more detailed description of these issues and adjustments is available in Appendix 1.
In order to make consistent comparisons across modelling groups, we have had to adjust the global emission estimates of some groups to ensure that all sectors and countries are covered. In the case where data were missing (e.g. international transport emissions), we have added the median value of other modelling groups' data. In addition, in order to ensure a consistent comparison with the results from Chapter 2 we have harmonised the data for the same 2005 emissions used in that chapter. These adjustments result in slightly different emission levels for each of the groups compared with those included in their publications. Appendix 3 provides more detail on the differences between modelling groups' findings and the adjustments made.
In Figure 2 we show median results for each case to reflect the clustering of results from modelling groups. In the text we report the 20th and 80th percentile range to reflect the majority of the results.



To estimate emissions expected in 2020 we have to make assumptions about the policy choices of governments. Since these choices are uncertain we specify four different cases, each giving a different combination of choices (Box 3a). The results for emissions are as follows (and are summarised in Figure 2):
As a reference point, without pledges global greenhouse gas emissions may increase from 45 GtC02e in 2005 to around 56 GtC02e in 2020 (with a range of 54-60 GtC02e) according to business-as-usual projections.
- Case 1 - ""Unconditional pledges, lenient rules"": this case would occur if countries stick to their lower-ambition pledges and are subject to ""lenient"" accounting rules. By this we mean that Annex I countries maximise the use of surplus emission units and ""lenient LULUCF credits"" (see Box 3b) to meet their targets. In this case, the median estimate of emissions in 2020 is 53 GtC02e per year, with a range of 52- 57 GtC02e.
- Case 2 - ""Unconditional pledges, strict rules"": This case would occur if countries stick to their lower-ambition pledges and are subject to ""strict"" accounting rules. By this we mean that the use of surplus units and ""lenient LULUCF credits"" is assumed to be zero. In this case, the median estimate of emissions in 2020 is 52 GtC02e, with a range of 50-55 GtC02e.
- Case 3 - ""Conditional pledges, lenient rules"": This case would occur if countries moved to their higher-ambition pledges (as conditions are either met or relaxed), but are subject to ""lenient"" accounting rules (as explained in case 1 above). This case was included because some of the more ambitious pledges of Annex
1 countries are conditional on some use of these credits or carry-over of surplus units (e.g. European Union, Russia). In this case, the median estimate of emissions in 2020 is 51 GtC02e, with a range of 49-53 GtC02e.
- Case 4 - ""Conditional pledges, strict rules"": This case would occur if countries moved to their higher-ambition pledges, and are subject to ""strict"" accounting rules (as explained in case
2 above). In this case, the median estimate of emissions in 2020 is 49 GtC02e, with a range of 47-51 GtC02e.
It is worth noting that there is the possibility of higher global emissions if international offsets are counted towards both industrialized and developing countries' pledges (the so-called ""double counting"" of offsets). It should also be noted that in some countries the impact of existing domestic policies or national plans could lead to lower emissions than the conditional pledges submitted to the Copenhagen Accord. International climate finance could also leverage further mitigation and lower emissions. All these issues have been analysed and found to have a significant effect on 2020 emissions. However, they are not included in any of these cases but are discussed as additional factors in Section 3.4 below.
From the analysis of these four cases it is interesting to note that the international policy options being discussed in the UNFCCC negotiations, and inherent in these cases, can significantly reduce the level of emissions in 2020. The most ambitious of the cases (case 4) is expected to be 7 GtC02e lower than business-as- usual emissions (range of 6-9 GtC02e lower).
For Annex I countries, in the least ambitious case (""unconditional pledges, lenient rules""), emissions are estimated to be 6 per cent above 1990 levels (range of
1- 12 per cent above) or equivalent to business-as-usual emissions in 2020. In fact, in many cases the use by Annex I countries of surplus units and ""lenient LULUCF credits"" provides more overall emission units than needed. This could result in higher emissions after 2020 if those units were to be banked for use in the following period.
In the most ambitious case (""conditional pledges, strict rules""). Annex I emissions in 2020 are expected to be 16 per cent below 1990 levels (range of 15-18 per cent below) and 20 per cent below business-as-usual emissions (range of 17-26 per cent).
For non-Annex I countries, in the least ambitious case (""unconditional pledges"") emissions are estimated to be 7 per cent lower than business-as-usual emissions (range of 6-8 per cent lower). In the most ambitious case (""conditional pledges""), non-Annex I emissions are 9 per cent lower than business-as-usual (range of 8-9 per cent lower).
This implies that the aggregate Annex I countries' emission goals are less ambitious than the 25-40 per cent reduction by 2020 (compared with 1990) suggested in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC 2007a). Collectively the non-Annex I countries' goals are less ambitious than the 15-30 per cent deviation from business-as-usual which is also commonly used as a benchmark (den Elzen and Hohne 2008, 2010). Whilst these values are helpful as a benchmark, it should be noted that, as described in chapters 2 and 4, various other emission pathways are consistent with the 2° C and 1.5° C temperature limits.
The cases presented in Figure 2 will be taken forward into the next chapter, which compares global emissions projections for 2020 with the emission pathways

3.3 ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ESTIMATES
The range between modelling groups' estimates can be split into three categories:
1 ) Differences between the four pledge cases,
2) Differences between estimates for the same pledge case, and
3) Other factors that could affect emissions
More detail on each of these issues and, where appropriate, the sources of estimates can be found online45 in Appendix 1. Figure 3 summarises the impact of these differences on the emissions of the four pledge cases, together with the further uncertainties described in the next section.
1) Differences between the four pledge cases
The four cases presented in Figure 2 are characterised by different assumptions on the conditionality of both Annex I and non-Annex I countries' pledges, LULUCF accounting rules and on the use of surplus units from the first commitment period and the possible creation of new surplus in the future. An overview of the impact of these assumptions is provided below - Appendix 1 has more details:
Unconditional versus conditional pledges
If countries were to move from unconditional to conditional pledges global emissions would be around 2- 3 GtC02e lower (with a range of estimates of 2-5 GtC02e). This breaks down as follows (numbers in parentheses show the annual 2020 emission reductions associated with moving from case 1 to 3 or from case 2 to 4 in Figure 2):
- Conditionality of Annex I (industrialized) countries (Oto-2.7 GtC02e): A significant number of Annex I countries have made pledges that are conditional on the actions of others or on the passing of domestic legislation. In some instances, countries also have unconditional pledges that will be implemented even if those conditions are not met.
- Conditionality of non-Annex I (developing) countries (0 to -0.7 GtC02e):_As was the case for the Annex I countries, some non-Annex I countries have included a range in their submissions, with the upper end of the range often being conditional on climate finance.
 ""Lenient"" versus ""strict"" rules
 If the rules in the negotiations regarding the use of LULUCF credits and surplus emission units were to be set in a ""strict"" rather than ""lenient"" manner, emissions could be around 1-2 GtC02e lower. This breaks down as follows (numbers in parentheses show the maximum possible increase in annual 2020 emissions reflected in the ""lenient"" cases)
 - LULUCF accounting rules (0 to +0.8 GtC02e):
The accounting rules that determine the extent to which LULUCF activities in Annex I countries could be used to meet their respective targets for the period after 2012 are still being negotiated. Most proposals in the negotiations would limit the number of ""lenient LULUCF credits"" by using historical or reference level baselines (see Box 3b).
 - Surplus emission units
Carry-over of surplus units from the first commitment period (0 to +1.3 GtC02e):
Surplus emission units can arise due to some countries exceeding their targets in the first commitment period. Countries with surplus units can also ""bank"" them and use them for meeting their target in a following commitment period post-2012, or sell them to other countries for their compliance.
Creation of new surplus units in a possible second commitment period: (0 to +1.0
GtC02e): Further surplus emission units can occur through some countries being allocated emission units significantly above the estimated business-as-usual level in a possible second commitment period. These units can be used by countries to meet their targets, or sell to other countries for their compliance.










It should be noted that the above issues are interdependent and will result in different emission reductions depending on the order in which they are implemented. Hence the numbers presented above cannot simply be added together and are, therefore, not easily traceable to the median results reflected in Figure 2 above49. In the reviewed studies, the total impact from these options (if taken together) would be a reduction in global emissions of 4 GtC02e (reflected in the move from Case 1 to 4 in the table), with a full range across studies of 3-8 GtC02e.
2) Differences between estimates for the same pledge case
Figure 2 shows that there is sometimes a large difference between modelling groups' estimates of the same cases. The main reasons for these differences are described below and, where possible, the uncertainty that each implies for 2020 global emissions. Numbers in parentheses give the range of 2020 emission estimates in Figure 2 that could be attributed to each of these reasons.

such activities would result in C02 removals from the atmosphere that could contribute to meeting, and thus should be counted towards, targets50.
The""strict""rules cases developed in this chapter reflect situations in which LULUCF credits such as those described above are provided. For calculation purposes, the quantity of LULUCF credits is set to zero in these cases - although some credits could occur. This is accurate because the resulting target emission level is the same and therefore it is not necessary to estimate the possible quantity of these LULUCF credits.
In the ""lenient"" case, on the other hand, we assume that credits are given for C02 removals by sinks that are expected to occur anyway in the absence of additional policy (e.g. from forests existing prior to 1990). Given that these direct-human induced emission removals are anyway part of the baseline emissions,51 the use of such credits would increase the estimate of 2020 global emissions. In this assessment we call such credits ""lenient LULUCF credits"". Specifically, we assume that ""lenient LULUCF credits"" of up to 0.8 GtC02e per year in 2020 could be generated in the ""lenient"" cases shown in Figure 2. See Appendix 1 for details.
3) Other factors that could affect emissions
There are a number of other factors not reflected in the range of estimates under each of these cases, but which could have a large impact on 2020 emissions. Modelling groups have generally not factored these issues into their central estimates for emissions resulting from the pledges—although many of the groups have estimated the impact of these issues separately. These factors include the following. Numbers in parentheses give the maximum annual 2020 emissions impact on the four cases:
- Double counting of offsets (0 to +1.3 GtC02e):
The potential for double counting of offsets towards both industrialized and developing country pledges, is a major source of uncertainty not reflected in Figure 2. This could occur if industrialized countries use offsets to meet their targets and that these same offsets also counted towards developing country pledges. A simple estimate of the risk of double counting can be made by assuming that 33 per cent of the deviation of Annex I emissions from business-as-usual is covered by offsets and that all of those are also counted towards non-Annex I goals. This would lead to emissions being around 1.3 GtC02e higher (as compared to the ""conditional pledge, strict rules"" case)
- 
Partial or ineffective delivery (0 to +2.0 GtC02e):
Any failure to carry out policies would undermine national efforts and lead to higher 2020 emissions; this would push countries' emissions back towards business-as-usual. Conversely, well-designed policies that spur innovation and investment could mean that goals are exceeded. All analyses covered in Figure 2 assume that countries will meet their targets. A crude assessment of the risk of partial implementation can be made by assuming that a certain proportion of the deviation from global business-as-usual is not delivered. Using 25 per cent would lead to estimates of 2020 emissions around 2.0 GtC02e higher than in Figure 2 (as compared to the ""conditional pledge, strict rules""case).
- International climate finance (0 to -2.5 GtC02e):
International climate finance could leverage further emission reductions beyond the conditional pledges of countries or in countries that have not yet specified mitigation actions. The upper bound of-2.5 GtC02e is found by a study that assumes that 25 per cent of Copenhagen Accord financing in 2020 will be used for additional mitigation actions (Carraro and Massetti, 2010).
- Ambitious domestic policy (0 to -1.5 GtC02e):
Certain countries have domestic plans that include mitigation actions that some analysts estimate to be more ambitious than the Copenhagen Accord pledges. The three modelling groups that have analysed this issue estimate that this could lead to emissions being up to 1.5 GtC02e lower than the Copenhagen Accord pledges would suggest.
Box 3c: Under what circumstances would the Copenhagen Accord pledges lead to a peak in global emissions before 2020?
Most of the emission pathways consistent with a likely chance of meeting the 2° C limit show emissions peaking before 2020 (see Chapter 2). Hence, peaking is an important indicator of whether pledges are consistent with the 2° C limit.
Making an assessment of whether global emissions peak between now and 2020 requires understanding of where the emissions will be in 2020, as well as their trajectory in the interval between now and then. If the emissions in 2020 are close to or below current levels, then it is possible that emissions will peak over this period. Estimates of current (2009) emission levels are around 48 GtC02e (Manning et al. 2010). Since only the most ambitious of the pledge cases comes close to current levels, we expect that this pledge case is the one most likely to result in a peak in emissions before 2020. By contrast, the least ambitious pledge case (""unconditional pledges, lenient rules"") results in a strong increase in emissions and is therefore the least likely to peak before 2020.
It should be noted that, it is also possible that emissions could peak before 2020, but still remain significantly above current levels in 2020. This could occur, for example, if the emission reduction policies are only introduced or start to take significant effect towards the end of this decade. However, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of this from the pledges alone.

Table 2 summarises the gaps that result from four different interpretations of how the pledges are followed, a nd for a ""likely"" (greater than 66 per cent) and a ""medium"" (50-66 per cent) chance of staying below 2°C.
In Chapter 2 it was shown that emission levels of 44 GtC02e in 2020 (range of 39-44) are consistent with a ""likely"" chance of limiting global warming to 2° C.


 

legislation. A smaller, but still important, part of the reduction would come from developing countries, whose pledges are sometimes conditional on the adequate provision of international climate finance or technology transfer.
In addition, the gap can be reduced by around 1 to 2 GtC02e by ensuring that ""strict"" rules apply to the use of LULUCF credits and surplus emission units. If industrialized countries apply ""strict"" accounting rules to minimise the use of what we refer to as ""lenient LULUCF credits"", they would strengthen the effect of their pledges and thus reduce the emissions gap by up to 0.8 GtC02e. Likewise, if the rules governing the use of surplus emission units under the Kyoto Protocol were designed in a way that would avoid the weakening of mitigation targets, the gap could be reduced by up to
2.3 GtC02e. These include units carried over from the current commitment period and any potential new surpluses created in the next. See Chapter 3 for more details4.
There are also a number of important factors, mentioned in Chapter 3, that could increase or decrease the gap and that are not included in these cases. The double counting of international offsets towards both industrialized and developing countries' goals could reduce the overall amount of mitigation and thus increase the gap by up to
1.3 GtC02e. Conversely, the implementation of ambitious existing national plans, beyond what is included in the Copenhagen Accord, could narrow the gap by up to 1.5 GtC02e (as compared to the fourth pledge case).
To have a ""medium"" rather than a /likely"" chance of staying below 2° C, the emission levels for the pledge cases can be about 1 GtC02e higher, and the corresponding gap 1 GtC02e lower for all pledge cases (Table 2).
Explanation of the range of results of the emissions gap for 2° C
The range of the gap presented for the different cases in Table 2 is based on the ""majority of results"" (20th to 80th percentile) across both the pledges and the 2° C emission levels. The upper bound estimate of the gap combines low 2° C emission levels (20th percentile) with high emissions from pledges (80th percentile). As explained in Chapter 2, emission levels consistent with the 2° C limit tend to be lower in 2020 when followed by comparatively slower emission reduction rates thereafter, or when negative emissions are not achieved over the long run.

Conversely, at the low end of the gap range we find a combination of higher 2° C emission levels in 2020 and low expected emissions as a result of the pledges. Emission levels that are consistent with 2° C tend to be higher in 2020 when reduction rates are comparatively high after 2020 (3.1 per cent per year) and/or it is assumed that negative emissions take effect over the long run. Under these conditions, emissions can afford to be higher in 2020, since they will be reduced more quickly afterwards.
The size of the gap is therefore strongly dependent on expectations about emission reduction rates after 2020 and the prospects for negative emissions later in the century. Both depend, of course, on the rate of technological development.
In addition, the reader will note that the range around median estimates is not symmetric; the lower bound extends by about 1-2 GtC02e below the median, whereas the upper bound rises 7-9 GtC02e above it (for a ""likely"" chance). This is found for all the pledge cases examined and arises because of the skewed distribution of pledge estimates with a more pronounced tail on the upper bound. One interpretation of this skewed range is that the gap may in reality tend to be on the higher side of the median.
This chapter has so far focused on the ""majority of results"" (20th to 80th percentile of estimates). Results outside this range indicate that emission levels for a ""likely"" chance of staying below 2° C could be as high as 48 GtC02e (Chapter 2), while at the same time expected emissions under case 4 (""conditional pledges, strict rules"") could, according to one estimate, be as low as 45 GtC02e in 2020. Under these conditions, no gap exists. On the other hand, looking at the other end of the range, we find 2° C emission levels for a ""likely"" chance of staying below the 2° C limit can range as low as 26 GtC02e, while the highest estimate of emissions under case 1 of the pledge cases (""unconditional pledges, lenient rules"") is 61 GtC02e, resulting in a gap as high as 35 GtC02e.
4.3 FINDINGS FOR 1.5° C
There is no emission pathway in the assessed 1AM literature of Chapter 2 that achieves the 1.5° C limit with a ""likely"" (greater than 66 per cent) chance and only one study in this literature depicts an emission pathway consistent with a medium (50-66 per cent) chance of meeting the 1.5° C limit (Magné et al. 2010). The 1AM pathways assessed that meet the 2°C limit with a ""likely"" chance suggest, however, that after a small (0.1-0.2° C) transient overshoot of the 1.5° C target, the temperature increase by the end of the twenty-first century could drop below 1.5° C, but with a lower probability. These pathways reach the 1.5° C target in the long-term with a median probability of 30 per cent (range of 27-35 per cent). Reaching 1.5° C with these lower probabilities would thus leave a similar emissions gap in 2020 as the one for a ""likely"" chance for 2° C. However, having a ""likely"" chance of reaching the 1.5° C target would require higher rates of emission reductions after 2020 (and correspondingly high rates of technological development and deployment) than those reported in the 1AM literature.
1. 
Implement conditional pledges: If all countries were to move to their conditional (high ambition) pledges, it would significantly narrow the 2020 emissions gap towards 2° C. The gap would be reduced by about 2 to 3 GtC02e, with most of the emission reductions coming from industrialized countries and a smaller, but important, share coming from developing countries.




4.4 CONCLUSIONS
We have seen in this chapter that a global emissions gap is likely between expected emissions as a result of the pledges and emission levels consistent with the 2° C limit in 2020. But our analysis of options for implementing the Copenhagen Accord pledges has also shown that this gap could be narrowed through any of the following policy options5:

This would require that conditions on those pledges be fulfilled. These conditions include expected actions of other countries as well as the provision of adequate financing, technology transfer and capacity building. Alternatively it would imply that conditions are relaxed or removed.
2. Minimise the use of ""lenient LULUCF credits"" and surplus emission units: If industrialized countries applied strict accounting rules to minimise the use of ""lenient LULUCF credits"" and avoided the use of surplus emissions units for meeting their targets, they would strengthen the effect of their pledges and thus reduce the emissions gap in 2020 by about 1 to 2 GtC02e (with up to 0.8 GtC02e coming from LULUCF accounting and up to 2.3 GtC02e from surplus emissions units).
 
3. Avoid double-counting of offsets: Double-counting of offsets could lead to an increase of the gap of up to 1.3 GtC02e, depending on whether countries implement their unconditional or conditional pledges (there is likely to be greater demand for offsets in the higher-ambition, conditional case). Hence avoiding double-counting could be an important policy option.
4. Implement measures beyond current pledges: The scenarios assessed in Chapter 2 indicate that it is technically possible to reduce emissions beyond present national plans in 2020.These scenarios show that the gap could be closed, and that emission levels consistent with 2° C could be achieved through the implementation of a wide portfolio of mitigation measures, including energy efficiency and conservation, renewables, nuclear, carbon capture and storage, non-C02 emissions mitigation, hydro-electric power, afforestation and avoided deforestation.
5. 
Lay the groundwork for faster emission reduction rates after 2020: Emission pathway consistent with a 2° C temperature limit are charactized by rapid rates of emission reduction post 2020 (of greater than 2.2 per cent per year). Such reduction rates on a sustained time- scale would be unprecedented historically. Therefore it is critical to lay the groundwork now for faster post 2020 emission reductions, for example, by avoiding lock-in of high-carbon infrastructure with long lifespans, or by developing and demonstrating advanced clean technologies.
 

5.3 CONCLUSIONS
The majority of results in this report show that emissions in 2020 expected from the Copenhagen Accord pledges are higher than emission levels consistent with a ""medium"" or ""likely"" chance of staying below 2° C and 1.5° C. At the same time they also show that the range of 2020 emission levels from the Copenhagen Accord pledges tends to be consistent with the 1AM pathways that have ""likely"" temperature increases of 2.5° C to 5° C up to the end of the twenty-first century.
However, this does not mean that a 2° C goal is infeasible. The 1AM literature shows that it remains possible to meet the temperature limits reviewed here, but the emission reduction rates required post 2020 are at the high end of what is currently assumed in the 1AM literature to be technologically and economically feasible. The 1AM literature also shows that options might be limited after 2020: a full range of low-emission technologies would have to be available and broad participation in global efforts to reduce emissions would be needed (Calvin et al. 2009, Clarke et al. 2009, Krey and Riahi 2009, van Vliet et al. 2009). Pathways capable of meeting the 2° C and 1.5° C limits require significant effort to develop technologies for achieving negative C02 emissions from energy and industry starting shortly after mid-century.
Commencing with such fast rates of emission reduction in 2020 and maintaining them for decades will require significant changes in underlying infrastructure and policy. Thus, if it is desired to meet temperature targets, two things appear to be required: first, countries would have to increase the ambition of their 2020 pledges; and second, society would have to put in place the policy, research, and investment processes to support and sustain such a rapid decline in emissions. Rapid rates of emission reduction will also require sustained global effort and cooperation, since action by only a small subset of countries will not be enough to reach temperature targets (Calvin et al. 2009, Clarke et al. 2009, Clarke and Weyant 2009, Krey and Riahi 2009, van Vliet et al. 2009).
In order to bring emissions in line with 1AM pathways that meet a 2° C limit, there is a need to not only implement current pledges fully, but also to raise the ambition of those pledges and lay the groundwork for faster and deeper reductions of post 2020 emissions. Going further in the short term and achieving stronger cuts to lower levels in 2020 would leave open more possibilities to meet temperature limits and would allow more flexibility in choosing a post 2020 pathway for global emissions.

The gaps between the coloured bands come about because this report mainly compiled pathways from low greenhouse gas stabilisation scenario.
 2The seemingly contradictory difference in reduction rates Is explained by the different shape of the post 2020 emission pathways. Van Vuuren etal.etal. (2007) show emissions declining shortly after 2020 and hence have a lower rate of reduction with a high likelihood of limiting temperature increase than O'Neill etal.etal. (2009), which decline later but faster and deeper.

 DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE DISCUSSION PAPERS



1. BACKGROUND
The overall objective of the EACC study is to better understand what adaptation to climate change really is and how-without such adaptation-development progress will be threatened and may even be reversed. The study has two broad objectives. The first objective is to develop a 'global"" estimate of adaptation costs.
This will aid the international community's efforts to help those developing countries most vulnerable to climate change meet adaptation costs. The second objective is to help decision makers in developing countries better understand and assess the risks posed by climate change and create better design strategies to adapt to climate change.
These two objectives require any quantitative scientific or economic analysis to (a) be spatially comprehensive, with globally comprehensive and consistent data sets; and (b) include plausibly extreme climate projections that span the plausible futures.
Due to the very large uncertainties of the scientific projections of climate change, it is important that any analysis provide information on the ""tails"" or extremes of any probability distribution of future climates. This allows decision makers in developing countries to better understand and assess the risks posed by climate change.
This document reports on the rationale for selection of climate change scenarios and climate data for the EACC global analysis.
2. 
CLIMATE DATA NEEDS FOR THE EACC
Climate change impacts that will require adaptation include (a) increased incidence of extreme weather events, which will draw resources away from development initiatives; (b) increased incidence of infectious and diarrheal diseases, which will reverse development gains in health standards; (c) changes in temperature and precipitation, which will affect agricultural productivity, making investments in this sector less productive: and (d) sea-level rise, which will lead to loss of lives and assets. Under the global track, adaptation costs for all developing countries are estimated by major economic sectors using country-level data sets that have global coverage. The agriculture, forestry, fisheries, infrastructure, water resources, coastal zones, health, and ecosystem services sectors are covered. The analysis also considers the cost implications of changes in the frequency of extreme weather events, including the implications for social protection programs (Figure 1).
The climate data needed for these analyses are summarized in Table 1.
The majority of sectors use a consistent set of future climate and water runoff projections to establish the nature of climate change. A consistent set of GDP and population projections also are used to establish a baseline of development in the absence of climate change. The analysis subsequently estimates the economic and social impacts and the corresponding costs of adaptation.
CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS AND CLIMATE CHANGE DATA






For historical climate data, we used a database provided by the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom. The CRU 2.1 data set provides a time series of monthly climate variables from 1901 to 2002. We extracted a subset of monthly climate variables required to compute potential évapotranspiration (average daily T minimum, average daily T maximum, vapor pressure, cloudiness) and precipitation . This data, provided on a 0.5° longitude/latitude grid, is the most frequently used standard reference ""baseline"" for global, regional, and local climate change impact studies. Excluding Antarctica, there are 67,420 grids (0.5° x 0.5°) over the global land area. The 0.5° degree longitude/latitude grids are not constant in area due to the spherical shape of the earth. Table 2 provides information on the size of the grid cells from the equator to the poles.
 



3. CLIMATE DATA FOR THE EACC GLOBAL TRACK
The analysis required a consistent global data set that covered data needs across all sectors and provided data for the entire global landmass with a time series of at least 30 years of monthly data. After examining a number of options, the team selected the CRU TS2.1 data set.

This provided a database used by all sectors. For some sectors, additional sources of daily data were needed. These data sources and characteristics are described in the sectoral reports.



4. SELECTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS
The IPCC Assessment (AR4) has archived climate change scenarios for three $RE$ scenarios and twenty- two global circulation models, resulting in fifty-six climate change scenarios. This was far too many scenarios to perform a global multisectoral adaptation analysis This section aims to answer the following question: Is there information from the climate science community that may assist in filtering 56 GCMS to a more manageable number?
REGIONAL PATTERNS AND EXTREMES IN CLIMATE MODELS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS
Evaluation of Models of the Present Climate An extensive volume of published research has evaluated climate models that simulated past climate variations and trends and predicted climate anomalies at the seasonal to inter-annual scales. We clearly have no shortage of evidence to indicate that climate models have the capability to simulate continental-scale coherent patterns of temperature-and to a lesser degree precipitation-and anomalies associated with large-scale climate phenomenon such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. However, key uncertainties-that is, disagreements with observations among climate models-still exist regarding the precise location, timing, and/or magnitude of temporal climate variations. One only needs to look at global precipitation patterns to recognize these quantifiable deficiencies in climate models. Among the most prominent shortcomings of most climate models (Figure 4 shows the mean of the IPCC AR4 climate models) is the notable split in maximum precipitation in the eastern tropical Pacific^ and to a lesser extent, in the western tropical Atlantic basin. In addition, the location and magnitude of the Indo-Asian Monsoon, as well as the South American rain-forest maximum precipitation as given by the model mean, disagree with observations.The model- mean results shown here also average out considerably larger differences in regional patterns (especially in the tropical regions) from individual models. These larger differences among the individual models (Figure 5) stem largely from assumption about atmospheric and ocean physics made by the model building team. Embedded within all these processes is also the ability of any given climate model to faithfully represent the diurnal cycle of these mechanisms.


This is of critics! importance for convective precipitation processes. At present all climate models show considerable deficiencies in representing the observed night-time maximum precipitation (most models release too much precipitation far too early, with a maximum occurring in the late afternoon). Nevertheless, we can be confident that the fundamental physics explicitly represented in climate models is sound, and the information they give us-as a whole or as a continuum of plausible outcomes-is useful. We must consider all their projections in the context of assessing potential impacts on and responses from our natural and managed systems.

Evaluation of heating for Climate Change Projections When considering the ability of climate models to accurately reproduce observed climate trends and anomalies, and how these results may then be confidently applied to projected (and potential) changes in climate over the next century, we can draw some insight and guidance from the following passage in chapter 3 of the IPCC 4*^ Assessment Report:
""What does the accuracy of a climate model's simulation of past or contemporary climate say about the accuracy of its projections of climate change? This question is just beginning to be addressed... studies show promise that quantitative metrics for the likelihood of model projections may be developed, but... the development of robust metrics is still at an early stage...""
As these remarks suggest, we cannot make a direct inference that because climate models can reproduce large-scale observed climatologies and accurately predict (or reproduce) climate anomalies , we should then have complete confidence in any one climate model or even a collection of climate models. This even holds for models that have been run at an exceptionally high level of spatial detail (such as the MIROC-Hires). Experience in climate evaluation, particularly in the area of hydro- logic variables, indicates that there is no ""best model"" and we must consider every model simulation individually. A simple example of this with respect to simulated climate change can be seen in the projected changes in precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and soil moisture shown in Figure 6. In the top set of panels, we see that the MIROC-Hires model would indicate a dramatic decrease in precipitation over much of the southern United States (extending north in the middle section of U.S.), which would pose a significant concern for water resource impacts. However, looking at the same result from the CCSM3 model, there is a complete reversal in the sign of the precipitation response over much of the southern U.S. (as well as the middle U.S.). The only area of consistency in sign to the MIROC-Hires result is in the southwestern U.S., but the CCSM precipitation decrease is considerably reduced. A similar situation can be seen for parts of Africa (MIROC showing large decreases, CCMS showing increases over much of Africa). Similarly, the changes in runoff (which can be regarded as the ""available surface water"") show similar marked discrepancies.
This simple example in the mean annual fields of the major hydrologic variables raises an important issue regarding impact and response assessments for water resources. If annual mean fields of changes show marked differences in sign and magnitude among climate models, the model average of these changes, not only at annual scales but also down to subdiurnal scales, is not an adequate input for impact, response, and adaptation assessments. To date, many studies have used the model mean as inputs, but it is important to move away from this practice, simply because a model ""average"" of near zero is not necessarily the result of a combination of models predicting a near-zero change, but could also be a result of two opposing changes that differ in sign (as seen in Figure 6). This could result in a substantial risk and/or consequence, and the abatement of the risk-no matter how slight the chance of climate change might be-may be worthwhile to consider for policy and/or mitigation strategies.
We must therefore consider all possible outcomes that are being produced by climate models, and feed these changes individually through impact assessment models, which may also provide a critical coupled feedback to the climate models via land-use change or water fluxes. While the potential exists for the range of simulated climate-change projections to vary so much among one another that they could be construed as ""noise,"" there is evidence to suggest that even when considering the collection of model outcomes, we see a consistency in some of the more salient changes. As an example, the trend in precipitation interval as simulated by the IPCC AR4 models show-statistically and/or probabilistically speaking-agreement in their projection of the change in precipitation interval across latitudes as the climate warms (Figures 7a, 7b).
What this implies is that although we cannot tie ourselves to one particular model outcome, we can have some confidence that we are not merely looking at ""noise,"" and there are regions where a sign change is consistent among the climate models-but with a range that is important to explicitly consider for assessment of potential impacts and adaptation.
While an approach that explicitly considers the range of possible climate-change outcomes as projected by global climate models is desirable, it is important to carefully consider whether there are some projections that should be filtered out as nearly implausible or at the very least, extremely unlikely. This is a difficult task, as there is no clear metric with appropriate or sufficient data that can identify whether a given climate change projection can or should be excluded, particularly when considering a specific region of interest. Further, if there is any chance that any given climate change simulation can occur, it should be considered within the spectrum of potential impact and/or adaptation-particularly if the risk of catastrophic damages and/or consequences is high. Therefore, it may be a worthwhile effort at the outset of any risk/impact assessment to consider all climate model projections (at very little computational cost), and that the exclusion of certain climate change scenarios might be considered if the costs and/or damage of its associated impacts were very low. It may also highlight outcomes that are beneficial, and these also are important in providing a comprehensive assessment of climate impacts and risks. Overall, the method of using model-mean as inputs to impact and risk assessments should be replaced with the usage of the full spectrum of results, as the ""tails"" of the full spectrum of model projections may contain the riskiest aspects of climate change.
Criteria for Selection of Climate Change Projections Given this context and the EACC study objective to help decision makers in developing countries to better understand and assess the risks posed by climate change, the team agreed to select two G CM scenarios that represented the extremes of climate change impacts on the globe. This section describes the criteria that should be used to evaluate climate change impacts.
The key economic sectors being evaluated in the EACC include agriculture, water resources, infrastructure, ecosystems, and health. All sectors are heavily influenced by soil moisture. Therefore the Climate Moisture Index (CMI), which is an indicator of the aridity of a region, was selected as an indicator to measure climate change impacts that would best represent impacts on the key sectors. The CMI depends on average annual precipitation and average annual potential évapotranspiration (PET).1 If PET is greater than precipitation, the climate is considered to be dry, whereas if precipitation is greater than PET, the climate is moist. Calculated as CMI = (P/PET)-1 {when PET>P} and CMI = 1-(PET/P) {when P>PET}, a CMI of-1 is very arid and a CMI of +1 is very humid. As a ratio of two depth measurements, CMI is dimensionless. The CMI can be evaluated at each of the 67420 grid cells of the CRU database (Figure 8).
It is a straightforward calculation to determine the CMI for each of the 56 GCMs. For the EACC, it was decided to use the average changes in monthly precipitation and temperature for the years 2046 to 2055 for each GCM. These average monthly changes were applied to the CRU 1961-90 average monthly temperature and precipitation to determine a CMI for each CGM. The CMI can be averaged over any spatial region. It was decided to select the two GCMs that represented the wet and dry GCM in 2050 over the land mass of the globe. Wet is defined as the GCM that had the largest increase in average CMI over the 1961- 90 CMI over the globe, while dry was defined as the CGM that had the largest decrease in average CMI over the 1961-90 CMI over the globe.
The reason the globe was selected rather than just over developing countries is that for the agricultural sector analysis, global food trade is a key element. Climate change impacts on agriculture in the developed world is a very important part of any analysis of climate change impacts on food, agriculture, and hunger in the developing world.
Figure 9 shows the range of CMI for all scenarios for the globe and World Bank Regions as a whole and the remaining land mass. Figure 10 show the CMI for all scenarios individually for each World Bank region. The red line represents the median CMI. The top of the box represents the 25^ percentile, while the bottom of the box represents the 75^ percentile. The whiskers show the extremes and the cross-hairs show the model outliers. The dashed lines represent the historical CMI (averaged from 1960-90). For example, in the LCR region, there is a 75 percent chance of drying with all three scenarios. The CMI for the SAR region has the largest spread because of the way the different GCMs model the monsoons. In the MNA region, there is not much variation because the area is so dry.

It is important to note that the CMI is only calculated over land masses and not over the ocean. Many climate change analyses discuss GCMs with regard to their properties results over land and sea, but for hydrology and water resources impacts all that matters is what is occurring over the land. One may notice that all the CMI in the box and whiskers plots are negative. These results show that warming leading to increases in potential évapotranspiration dominates over increased precipitation over the globe's land mass, leading to an increase in aridity or a drying for more than 75 percent of all GCMs.

Selection of Climate Change Projections Figures 9 and 10 show that the 56 GCMs provide for a large range of CMI for the globe, developing countries, and each individual World Bank region. However, for reasons related to socioeconomic baseline consistency, the EACC team decided to limit GCM scenarios to those run for the A2 $RE$ scenario. This reduced the possible number of GCMs to 17.
A further constraint was placed on the suite of candidate GCMs. The agricultural sector required that the GCM selected must provide monthly Tmin and Tmax to the AR4 archive. This limited the number of SRE$ A-2 to six that met all constraints.




Based on the global CMI analysis, the CSIRO IVlK_3_0 was selected as the EACC dry climate scenario and NCAR_CCSM was selected as the wet
climate scenario. Figures 11 and 12 are a plot of the annual precipitation changes in 2050 for the dry and wet scenarios, respectively.
Figures 13 and 14 are plots of the annual maximum temperature changes in 2050 for the dr)' and wet scenarios, respectively temperature, calculated modified Penman-Ivlonteith potential évapotranspiration (PET), and calculated Civil for 2030 and 2050. Annual results are in Appendix A, seasonal results are in Appendix B, and monthly results are in Appendix C.




5. USE OF CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS
The spatial and temporal scale of impact and adaptation analyses needed for the EACC sectoral analyses span a wide range from very small (1-10 km^ and daily to weekly) for local village water supply to very large catchments (100,000 km^ and monthly to yearly) for major reservoirs. Climate change will occur at local scales, but models currently used for projecting climate change due to future GHG emissions have an average resolution of 2.6° x 3.0°. One potential difficulty with using climate information in impact assessments is the mis-match between the low spatial (and temporal) resolution of GCMs, on the one hand, and the scale at which assessments need typically to be conducted, on the other. GCMs provide climate change projections at a low spatial resolution (-2.5° x 2.5° grid), while the EACC is using a much finer resolution (~0.5° x 0.5° grid )
There are several methods available for addressing scale issues, including statistical downscaling (using empirical relationships), dynamical downscaling (using regional climate models), and spatial techniques2 (linear interpolation, krigging, spline fitting, and intelligent interpolation). Downscaling involves methods used to map the large-scale signals from GCMs to a finer resolution (tens of kilometers versus hundreds of kilometers).
Care needs to be taken in selecting a method. Beyond reproducing the underlying uncertainties of GCMs, many introduce additional uncertainty and biases. For example, downscaling techniques increase the detail of information, but also the uncertainties associated with that information since the GCM output is manipulated below the scale at which the physics of the GCM itself are mathematically described. Under some downscaling schemes, mass balances of water and energy over the GCM scale are violated by the downscaling algorithm. Use of dynamic and statistical downscaling techniques requires extensive quantification of the sensitivities of the underlying assumptions of both the GCMs and the downscaling algorithms, resulting in the need for exhaustive numerical experimentation. Time and cost constraints often do not allow use of more than a couple of GCMs in downscaling exercises. Running multiple GCMs at a coarse resolution may provide more insight into the range of possible futures than more detailed information obtained from fewer GCMs
There is no one ""best"" method; the most appropriate method for a particular application will strike a careful balance between precision (resolution) and accuracy (confidence in projections). Figure 15 provides a visual representation of the trade-off between precision and accuracy. As resolution increases, so too does the uncertainty associated with the more detailed information. In other words, more ""precise"" information comes at a cost, and the additional uncertainty must be recognized and taken into account in assessing impacts. Given the trade-off, it is critical to establish at the outset of any impact assessment whether the goal is to have finer resolution or ""better""-that is, more reliable-information.
Sub-GCM Grid Scale Climate Change Projections For this work the spatial resolution for the use of GCM was at the native grid scale of each GCM. The GCM provided relative changes in temperature and precipitation for the years 2030 (average over 2026 to 2035) and 2050 (average over 2046 to 2055) on a monthly level as compared to the model baseline (1961-90) of the 20th century. These relative changes were then applied directly to the historic climate variables from the CRU data set. As seen in Figure 15, there are numerous half degree by half degree CRU grids within each GCM grid box. For this analysis, we apply the relative changes from the GCM grid box uniformly to all CRU grid cells within the GCM grid box. While this leads to some discontinuities at the border of grid boxes, it is the most appropriate technique for this work given the scope and mathematics of the GCM models.
With the uncertainty inherent in the GCM and the CRU data, it would be unwise to perform this analysis at the lowest level of resolution; half degree by half degree. Aggregating to a higher spatial level would reduce the uncertainty in the model indicators and more correctly reflect the larger scale climate change projections from the GCM models. For the agricultural sector analysis, a large-scale food producing unit (FPU) is the unit of analysis; for the water resources analysis, a catchment scale (refer to Figure 15) is used; and for infrastructure and health, a national-scale analysis is used.

WMO statement on the status of the global climate in 2008



Foreword



In 1873 the First International Meteorological Congress assembled in Vienna to establish the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), which by 1929 had launched its Commission for Climatology, During August 1947, the ten IMO technical commissions and its six regional commissions held their respective sessions simultaneously in Toronto, Canada. These meetings immediately preceded the Washington (Eighth) Conference of Directors of Meteorological Services, which in October 1947 unanimously approved the Convention of a new organization: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Following the necessary ratifications, WMO took over the IMO responsibilities on 23 March 1950 and, one year later, WMO became a specialized agency of the United Nations system.
Fifty years after the founding of the IMO Commission for Climatology, in 1979 WMO organized the First World Climate Conference, in collaboration with the International Council for Science, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This historic conference led to the establishment of the WMO World Climate Programme and, in 1980, to the World Climate Research Programme, which WMO first co-sponsored with the International Council for Science and subsequently also with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, Furthermore, the conference paved the way for the 1988establishment of the WMO/UNEP co-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which received the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for its efforts ""to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change"".
The Second World Climate Conference, which WMO organized with partners in 1990, provided decisive momentum to the international efforts that resulted in the development of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Global Climate Observing System, In the wake of these historic events, WMO began to issue in 1993 its annual report ""WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate"", which by now has become a well-established source of authoritative information, eagerly sought after every year by the scientific community and the media. The WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2008 is the latest in this successful series.
The year 2008 was notable, in particular, as it signalled positive global temperature anomalies, which positioned it among the ten warmest on record since the beginning of modern measurements in 1850, Several extreme weather and climate events were recorded in various parts of the world in 2008, of which perhaps the most dramatic was tropical cyclone Nargis, which made landfall in Myanmar in May, causing catastrophic destruction and more than 70 000 fatalities. Other parts of the world suffered severe flooding, extreme heat waves and droughts in 2008, while Arctic sea ice was once more observed to decline markedly, reaching during September its second-lowest historic extent,
I would like to highlight that 2008 was the second year of the International Polar Year 2007-2008, a WMO co-sponsored scientific venture that has already made decisive contributions to our scientific understanding of climate in the polar regions.
I wish to express the appreciation of WMO to all the Centre sand the National Meteorological and Hydrologicai Services of WMO Members that collaborated with WMO and contributed to the present publication. As with previous editions, I would like to underscore the importance of receiving your feed back, WMO looks forward to your comments on the WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2008 and to your welcome suggestions for its further improvement.

Global temperature during 2008
The year 2008 ranked as one of the warmest years on record according to the analyses made by leading climate centres. The Met Office Hadley Centre analyses showed that the global combined sea surface and land surface air temperature for 2008 was 0.31°C (0.56°F) above the 1961–1990 annual average of 14.0°C (57.2°F), ranking 2008 as the tenth warmest year on record. According to the National Climatic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the global mean surface temperature anomaly was 0.49oC (0.88oF) above the twentieth century average (1901–2000), which ranks 2008 as the eighth warmest year on record.
Based on the joint Met Office Hadley Centre and Climate Research Unit, University of East Anglia analyses, in 2008 the northern and southern hemispheres, with a mean temperature anomaly of +0.51oC (+0.92oF) and +0.11oC (+0.20oF), ranked ninth and seventeenth, respectively.
The global average temperature in 2008 was slightly lower than for the previous years of the twenty-first century, owing in part to the moderate-to-strong La Niña that devel- oped in the latter half of 2007. The global mean temperature anomaly in January 2008 (+0.05oC/+0.09oF) was the lowest recorded since February 1994 (–0.09oC /–0.16oF).











































All temperature values have uncertainties, which arise mainly from gaps in data coverage. The size of the uncertainties is such that, for example, although 2008 is nominally the tenth warmest year on record, it could lie anywhere between the seventh and fourteenth warmest years.
Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the global average surface temperature has risen by 0.74°C, although this increase has not been continuous. The linear warming trend over the past 50 years (0.13°C per decade) is nearly twice that for the past 100 years.
 Note: Following established practice, WMO global temperature analyses are based on two different datasets. One is the combined datas et maintained by the M et Office Hadley Centre, UK, and the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, UK. The other is maintained by the United States Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Both centres use improved temperature analyses, but different methodologies. These differing methodologies may result in small differences in global ranking.
Regional temperature anomalies
In 2008 most parts of the world experienced yet again a year of above-average temperatures.The northern hemisphere, particularly Europe, Asia and the North Atlantic, had the largest anomalies (the anomalies reached between +1°C and +3°C); conversely, part of the United States and Canada experienced slightly cooler than average temperatures. In the southern hemisphere, over the ocean and south of 45° latitude, the temperatures were mostly below average.
Europe and Asia
A large geographical area, including northwestern Siberia and part of the Scandinavian region, recorded a remarkably mild winter. January and February were very mild in most of Europe. Monthly mean temperature anomalies for these months exceeded +7°C in some places in Scandinavia. In most parts of Finland, Norway and Sweden, winter 2007/2008 was the warmest recorded since the beginning of measurements. The previous mildest winter in Finland was the 1924/1925 winter, more than 80 years ago. Large parts of Western Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria, had an exceptionally sunny February with some areas recording over double their monthly average sunshine duration. The United Kingdom experienced its sunniest winter since 1929.
The boreal winter was remarkably cold for a large part of Asia, extending eastward from Turkey to China. Some places in Turkey expe- rienced their coldest January nights in nearly 50 years. This extreme cold weather caused hundreds of casualties in Afghanistan and China. In January the mean temperatures reached anomalies between –4oC and –10oC around this region. Spring was very warm in large parts of Europe and Asia, especially in March when anomalies were above +5oC in
central and north-west Asia. In addition, several heatwaves occurred in south-eastern Europe and the Middle East during April. In Crete, Greece, the temperature of 37.4°C recorded on 22 April was the highest ever measured on the island for that month. Summer was also warmer than average in most parts of Europe and Asia, as was autumn, particu- larly November, when significant temperature anomalies ranging between +3°C and +5°C were recorded from eastern Europe to central Asia.
North America
The year started warmer than normal across Canada and the central-eastern United States, but cooler than average in the western United States. Two daily maximum temperatures
Below average activity 7 storms, 3 cyclones
records were set in Toronto on 7 and 8 January when temperatures soared to 14°C. February was much colder than average across Canada, Alaska and the northern United States, with average daily temperatures ranging from 4.0°C to 5.0°C below normal in some areas. In spring, temperatures were cooler than average in most parts of the United States and Canada, and warmer than average in Mexico, During the summer season, temperatures were near normal except in eastern Canada. November was also particularly mild over Canada and the western part of the United States.
South America
Between January and April, above-normal temperatures predominated over southern South America; conversely, below-normal temperatures were recorded in the central and north-western part of the region. During the same period, southern Argentina and Chile were affected by persistent atmospheric blocking situations that brought very hot weather to the area. February was particularly warm throughout this region. Many locations recorded the warmest February in 50 years, with daily maximum temperatures reaching between 35°C and 40°C, well above the average, which ranges between 20°C and 28°C.
May was colder than average especially because of an early Antarctic air mass out- break that affected southern South America, particularly central and northern Argentina, where the minimum temperature dropped below-6°C in some locations, breaking annual absolute minimum temperature records. Conversely, mean July temperatures were more than +3°C above average in large parts of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, south-east Bolivia and southern Brazil, making it the warmest July in the past 50 years for many locations. November also broke historical temperature records in part due to an unusual heatwave at the end of the month in central Argentina.
Australia
In Australia, the year started with the hottest January since 1950, An exceptionally prolonged heatwave affected much of southern Australia in March, For example, Adelaide had its longest running heatwave on record, with 15 consecutive days of maximum temperatures above 35°C, well in excess of the previous record of 8 consecutive days. Despite this, the rest of the austral autumn was characterized, in much of the country, by above-average daytime and below-average overnight temperatures. In Queensland, the first ever sub-zero March minimum (~0,2°C) was recorded at Stanthorpe, while Kalumburu (Western Australia) and Kowanyama (Queensland) had 60 or more consecutive below-normal nights, extending from earlyApril to early June. September and October were very warm months ranking, with the two-month combined period, second behind 1988.
Global precipitation
In 2008, global precipitation over land was slightly above the 1961-1990 average. Precipitation throughout the year was variable in many areas, Less than average conditions were observed across the western and south-central contiguous United States; southwestern Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands; south-eastern Africa; southern Europe; northern India ; and parts of Argentina, Uruguay, eastern Asia and southern Australia. Most of Europe, western Africa, the north-eastern and central contiguous United States, parts of northern South America, south-eastern Asia and northern Australia experienced wetter than average conditions.





Drought
At the end of July, most parts of the south-east of North America were classified as having moderate to exceptional drought conditions, based on the United States Drought Monitor. The continuous dry conditions across northern and central California resulted in numerous large wildfires.
In Canada, southern British Columbia experienced its fifth driest period in 61 years. In Europe, Portugal and Spain experienced their worst winter drought in decades.
South America, including the centre-east and north-east of Argentina, and a large part of Uruguay, Paraguay and southern Brazil, was particularly hit by a severe and prolonged drought, which started in the latter half of 2007. The precipitation index used in Argentina, as shown in Figure7 for the northeast region, shows the severity and duration of this drought. This drought caused some damage to agriculture, livestock and water resources. During 2008, the total precipitation was between 40 and 60 per cent below normal and many locations recorded one of the driest years since 1900.

In south-eastern Australia dry conditions reinforced long-term drought over much of that region. This was the third consecutive year in which the September-October period was exceptionally dry. These conditions exacerbated severe water shortages in the agriculturally important Murray-Darling Basin, resulting in widespread crop failures in the area.
Extreme storms and flooding
In January, 1.3 million square kilometres (km2) in 15 provinces in southern China were covered by snow. Persistent low tempe rature and icing affected the daily lives of millions of people who suffered not only from damage to agriculture, but also from disruptions in transport, energy supply and power transmission.
In Canada, several all-time snowfall records were set during winter, reaching more than 550 centimetres (cm) in many locations, including Quebec City, In Toronto, it was the third snowiest winter on record for the past 70years. At the end of January, Prince Edward Island was struck by one of the worst ice storms in decades.
In the United States, heavy April rainfall, combined with previously saturated ground and snowmelt, resulted in widespread major flooding that affected Missouri and southern Indiana, During June, 78 stations reported their wettest day of any June and 15 of these stations set a new all-time record for the wettest 24-hour period for any month. Also, 2008 was one of the top 10 years for tornado-related fatalities (123) since reliable records began in 1953. According to statistics, 2 192 tornadoes were recorded during the year, well above the 10-year average of 1 270,
In Germany, between May and September, a large number of strong thunderstorms with heavy rain, tornadoes and hailstorms were observed, causing some casualties and significant damage.
Sub-Saharan Africa, including West and East Africa, was affected by heavy rains, which caused the worst-ever recorded flooding in Zimbabwe and affected more than 300 000 people in West Africa during the monsoon season.
In northern Africa, heavy and extended rainfall during the September-November period affected Algeria and Morocco, causing important infrastructure damage and several casualties. Extreme rainfall intensities with up to 200 millimetres (mm) of rainfall in less than six hours were recorded in the northern provinces of Morocco. Within the same climate anomaly context and period, intense rainfall was also recorded in southwestern Europe. In Valencia, Spain, a total rainfall of 390 mm was recorded in 24 hours, of which 144 mm was recorded in less than 1 hour. In France, heavy and intense rains affected several locations from 31 October to 2 November. In those three days, total rainfall reached 500 mm in some locations, which caused severe flooding and flash floods, particularly in the central and east-central parts of the country.
Several major rain events affected eastern Australia in January and February, causing significant flooding, particularly in Queensland. In November, widespread heavy rains occurred across most of the continent, ending an extremely dry period in central Australia. Associated severe thunderstorms caused damage from winds, hail and flash floods in many places.
In southern Asia, including India, Pakistan and Viet Nam, heavy monsoon rains and torrential downpours produced flash floods, killing more than 2 600 people, and displacing 10 million people in India.
In western Colombia, continuous above normal rainfall resulted in severe flooding and landslides that affected at least half a million people and caused extensive damage during the second half of the year.
In Southern Brazil, intense rainfall affected Santa Catarina state from 21 to 24 November, causing severe flooding and deadly mudslides, which affected 1.5 million people and resulted in more than 80 casualties. During this period, more than 500 mm of rainfall was recorded, including more than 200 mm of rainfall in 24 hours (breaking historical records for 24-hour rainfall), for example, at Blumenau, Balneârio Camboriü, Sâo Francisco do Sul, Itapoa and Biguaçü.

Tropical cyclones

The most deadly tropical cyclone recorded in 2008 was Nargis, which developed in the North Indian Ocean and hit Myanmar in early May, killing more than 70 000 people and destroying thousands of homes. Nargis was the most devastating cyclone to hit Asia since 1991 and resulted in the worst natural disaster on record for Myanmar.
A total of 16 named tropical storms formed in the Atlantic, including 8 hurricanes, 5 of which were major Category 3 or higher, compared with the long-term average of 11 tropical storms, 6 hurricanes, 2 which were Category 3 or higher. The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was devastating, with many casualties and widespread destruction in the Caribbean, Central America and the United States. For the first time on record, six consecutive tropical cyclones (Dolly, Edouard, Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike) made landfall on the United States, and a record of three major hurricanes (Gustav, Ike and Paloma) hit Cuba. Hanna, Ike and Gustav were the deadliest hurricanes of the season, causing several hundred casualties in the Caribbean, including 500 deaths in Haiti.
In the East Pacific, 17 named tropical storms were recorded, of which 7 evolved into hurricanes and 2 into major hurricanes, compared with averages of 16, 9 and 4, respectively.
In the western North Pacific, 22 named tropical storms were recorded; of these, 11 were classified as typhoons compared with the long-term averages of 27 and 14, respectively. The Philippines, Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand, Viet Nam and south-eastern China were severely affected by these events. For the first time since 2001, no named tropical cyclones made landfall in Japan during the year.
In the broader Australian region, tropical cyclone numbers during the 2007/2008 season were close to normal, with a total of 10 systems. However, it was a quiet season for landfalls and intense systems.

Weakening of La Nina
The first quarter of 2008 was characterized by a La Nina event of moderate to strong intensity, which began in the second half of 2007 and prevailed through May 2008. The large area of cool surface waters over the bulk of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, combined with warmer than normal conditions in the equatorial western Pacific, represented typical La Nina forcing on the global atmosphere. La Nina conditions gradually weakened from their peak strength in February, and near-neutral conditions prevailed during most of the latter half of 2008. However, cold sea surface temperatures developed in December in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Atmospheric wind patterns coupled with the cooler than normal surface waters, generally indicating La Nina conditions, across the tropical Pacific towards the end of the year.

Antarctic ozone hole larger than in 2007

The ozone hole area reached a maximum of 27 million km2 on 12 September. This is less than in the record years of 2000 and 2006 (more than 29 million km2), but larger than in 2007 (25 million km2). The variation in the size of the ozone hole from one year to another can be explained, to a large extent, by the meteorological conditions in the stratosphere, as ozone depletion becomes more severe if the stratosphere is cold. Temperature conditions in the 2008 Antarctic stratospheric vortex were colder than in 2007 but warmer than in 2006. Over the next few years, the variation in the severity of ozone hole will be governed by inter-annual changes in meteorology rather than changes in ozone depleting substances, whose decline is quite slow.

Arctic sea ice down to second-lowest extent

Arctic sea-ice extent during the 2008 melt season dropped to its second-lowest level since satellite measurements began in 1979, reaching the lowest point in its annual cycle of melt and growth on 14 September 2008.

Average sea-ice extent over the month of September, a standard measure in the scientific study of Arctic sea ice, was 4,67 million km2. The record monthly low, set in 2007, was 4,3 million km2. As the ice was thinner in 2008, its overall volume was less than that in any other year, A remarkable occurrence in 2008 was the dramatic disappearance of nearly one quarter of the massive ancient ice shelves on Ellesmere Island, The season strongly reinforces the 30-year downward trend in Arctic sea-ice extent.
For the first time in recorded history, the navigable deep-water routes of the fabled Northwest Passage over the top of North America, and the Northeast Passage over the top of the Russian Federation, were simultaneously free of ice. The year 2008 marked the third consecutive summer that ships could easily navigate the Northwest Passage without hitting or being blocked by sea ice.

In most regions of the world there are longer instrumental records than apparent in a cursory search of the website or archives of a National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (NMHS). In most cases this results from the NMHS not yet having digitized all the meteorological data in its archives. In many cases the records pre-date the founding of the Service, whereas in others they pre-date the founding of the country. It is important that these early records, which were often taken with meticulous care by early scientists and medical doctors, be digitized and made available for climatological use. These early records are generally to be found in national or learned society archives, sometimes located in the archives of an earlier colonial power. Present-day scientists owe their forebears much gratitude for taking these early measurements with meticulous care and diligence. Given this effort, it would be a shame if they were left to collect more dust in an archive.
Extending climatic series brings a number of scientific benefits, both to the NMHS and to the climatological research community in the country and in the region. The primary benefit is that the longer records enable trends and other ana lyses to be more extensive, placing recent records and extremes in the longer context. Longer climatic series also provide instrumental data for more extensive calibration of natural and documentary proxies, both of which have the potential for extending the climatic history further back in time. Longer observational data provide better coverage (in both space and time) for extended reanalysis projects, planned to begin from the late nineteenth century. Lastly, longer records are useful for assessing impacts of climate change over more extensive time frames than just the recent past. The following two examples discuss the above for northern and western Europe. They illustrate what has been achieved through more extensive digital instrumental data.


Longer records for the assessment of proxy evidence
Longer climatic reconstructions require information from natural (for example, trees and ice cores) and documentary (written archives) proxy material. These proxy records must use instrumental records to calibrate the proxy source. In many regions, calibration is hampered by the lack of long instrumental records. In Europe, however, it is generally possible to assess the quality of possible reconstructions, especially the longer decadal-timescale details, for almost 200 years. The figure shows examples of such calibration exercises using a long instrumental record developed for northern Fennoscandia. Both proxy series show good replication of instrumental temperatures at the inter-annual and decadal timescales.

Extensions of the North Atlantic Oscillation

The longest record of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), back to 1820, has been derived by Jones and others (1997) based on pressure data from Gibraltar and Reykjavik. As the NAO is essentially a measure of the westerly wind strength over western Europe, two long well-located pressure records would provide a good surrogate for the more distant locations in Iceland and southern Iberia or the Azores. The two locations with the greatest
potential length anywhere in the world are Paris and London. At both sites, near-continuous daily pressure records have been taken since the late seventeenth century. For Paris, a complete record has been developed back to 1677, missing only most of the years in the 1720s and 1730s. For London, the record is complete from 1692, missing only the years between 1717 and 1722. Despite these short gaps, a very useful approximation to the winter NAO has been developed back to 1692.

G.1,GLOSSARY,Glossary,G.2 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,,"A relative measure of the exactness of an emission or removal estimate. Estimates should be accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over nor under true emissions or removals, so far as can be judged.
Activity
A practice or ensemble of practices that take place on a delineated area over a given period of time.
Activity data
Data on the magnitude of a human activity resulting in emissions or removals taking place during a given period of time. Data on energy use, metal production, land areas, management systems, lime and fertilizer use and waste arisings are examples of activity data.
Agricultural pond
An artificial storage containing water for agricultural (irrigation) or pastoral (stock watering) uses. They are typically unlined and constructed using a combination of earthen embankments and the natural topography on the landscape. They can range in size from very small farm dams (< 50 m2) to very large (> 10 km2).
Allochthonous
Material or formation originating outside the water body.
Allometric model
A formula that quantitatively describes an allometric relationship.
Allometry
The relative dimensional relationships between body parts that grow at different rates.
Anaerobic
Conditions in which oxygen is not readily available. These conditions are important for the production of methane emissions. Whenever organic material decomposes in anaerobic conditions (in landfills, flooded rice fields, etc.) methane is likely to be formed.
Andosol
A soil developed in volcanic ash. Generally andosols have good drainage and are prone to fertility problems.
Approaches to consistent representation of lands
Approach 1: Represents land-use area totals within a defined spatial unit, which is often defined by political boundaries, such as a country, province or municipality.
Approach 2: The essential feature of Approach 2 is that it provides an assessment of both the net losses or gains in the area of specific land-use categories and what these conversions represent (i.e., changes both from and to a category). Thus, Approach 2 differs from Approach 1 in that it includes information on conversions between categories, but is still only tracking those changes without spatially-explicit location data, often based on political boundaries (i.e., locations of specific land-use and land-use conversions are not known).
Approach 3: The key defining characteristic of Approach 3 is that it is both spatially and temporally consistent and explicit. Sample-based, survey-based and wall-to-wall methods can be considered Approach 3 depending on the design of the sampling/mapping program and the way the data is processed and analysed.
Aquaculture pond
An artificial storage containing water for the production of aquatic animals or plants. They are typically unlined and constructed using a combination of earthen embankments and the natural topography on the landscape. They can range in size from (< 50 m2) to (> 10 km2).
Arithmetic mean
The sum of the values divided by the number of values.
Auto producer
An enterprise which generates electricity or heat for its own use and/or sells it as a secondary activity i.e., not as its main business.
Autochthonous
Material or formation originating from inside the water body.
 G.3
Back-casting
The opposite of forecasting. Predicting conditions in the past from current conditions.
Backflows
By-product oils from petrochemical processing of refinery products which are generally returned to the refinery for further processing into petroleum products.
Base year
The starting year for the inventory. Currently this is typically 1990.
Benthic chlorophyll
An indicator of the eutrophication status of a water body based on the presence of microalgae at the sediment-water interface at the bottom of the water body.
Bias
A systematic error of the observation and estimation method, whose magnitude in most cases is unknown. It can be introduced by using measuring equipment that is improperly calibrated, by selecting items from a wrong population or by favouring certain elements of a population, etc. For example: Estimating the total fugitive emission from gas transport and distribution using only measurements of leakage from high/medium pressure pipelines can lead to bias if the leakage in the lower pressure distribution network (which is significantly more difficult to measure) is neglected.
Biochar
For the purpose of this report, biochar is defined as a solid material generated by heating biomass to a temperature in excess of 350 °C under conditions of controlled and limited oxidant concentrations to prevent combustion. These processes can be classified as either pyrolysis (in which oxidants are excluded), or gasification (in which oxidant concentrations are low enough to generate syngas).
Bioenergy
Energy derived from any form of biomass.
Biofuels
Any fuels derived from biomass, either deliberately grown or from waste products. Peat is not considered a biofuel in these guidelines due to the length of time required for peat to re-accumulate after harvest.
Biogenic carbon
Carbon derived from biogenic (plant or animal) sources excluding fossil carbon. Note that peat is treated as a fossil carbon in these guidelines as it takes so long to replace harvested peat.
Biological treatment of waste
Composting and anaerobic digestion of organic wastes, such as food waste, garden/park waste and sludge, to reduce volume in the waste material, stabilisation of waste, and destruction of pathogens in the waste material. This includes mechanical-biological treatment.
Biomass
(1) The total mass of living organisms in a given area or of a given species usually expressed as dry weight. Includes above and below ground living biomass.
(2) Organic matter consisting of or recently derived from living organisms (especially regarded as fuel) excluding peat. Includes products, by-products and waste derived from such material.
Blowing agent (for foam production)
A gas, volatile liquid, or chemical that generates gas during the foaming process. The gas creates bubbles or cells in the plastic structure of a foam.
Bootstrap technique
Bootstrap technique is a type of computationally intensive statistical method which uses repeated resampling with replacement from a set of data to assess variability of parameter estimates. Bootstrap technique is a specific case of a Monte Carlo method.
Boreal
See polar/boreal.

G.4 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Calcium carbide
Calcium carbide is used in the production of acetylene, in the manufacture of cyanamide (a minor historical use), and as a reductant in electric arc steel furnaces. It is made from calcium carbonate (limestone) and carbon-containing reductant (e.g., petroleum coke).
Canal
An artificial waterway typically constructed with a uniform cross-section to provide navigation or to transport water for irrigation, hydropower, town water supplies, etc. They may be earthen structures or they may have concrete linings. “Canals are generally long and narrow, with a uniform width and depth, and have a single outlet.” <<https://www.ramsar.org/news/ramsar-topics-report-on-canal-estates>>
Carbon budget
The balance of the exchanges of carbon between carbon pools or within one specific loop (e.g., atmosphere – biosphere) of the carbon cycle. This is a generic definition of “carbon budget” in the context of national greenhouse gas inventories. This term may be defined with other specific meaning in the other context. (For example, see the Glossary of IPCC Special Report “Global Warming of 1.5°C”).
Carbon dioxide equivalent emission
The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a mixture of GHGs. There are a number of ways to compute such equivalent emissions and choose appropriate time horizons. Most typically, the CO2-equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its global warming potential (GWP) for a 100-year time horizon.
Carbon sequestration
The process of storing carbon in a carbon pool.
Category
Categories are subdivisions of the four main sectors Energy; Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU); Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU); and Waste. Categories may be further divided into sub-categories. For details, see Chapter 8 of Volume 1.
Census
A census is a survey conducted on the full set of observation objects belonging to a given population or universe.
Channel
A generic term for a waterway that encompasses creeks, streams, rivers, canals, ditches etc., as applied in the AFOLU sector for national greenhouse gas inventories.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
Halocarbons containing only chlorine, fluorine, and carbon atoms. CFCs are both ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and greenhouse gases.
Chronosequence
Chronosequences in this report are used in the context of the AFOLU sector, and consist of a temporal sequence in land use or management, for example, years since deforestation, which are used to evaluate change over time. Efforts are made to control all other between-site differences (e.g., by selecting areas with similar soil type, topography, previous vegetation). Chronosequences are often used as a surrogate for experimental studies or measurements repeated over time at the same location.
Climate sub-domain
A subset of a climate zone into which lands may be grouped for the purposes of inventory calculations. Used to provide finer resolution of climate gradients within one of the six climate zones.
Co-digestate
Supplemental material added to anaerobic digesters, in addition to the main digestion material (manure in the case of agricultural digesters) to increase methane yield.
 G.5
Coefficient of variation
Statistical definition: The coefficient of variation, vx is the ratio of the population standard deviation, σx, and mean, μx, where vx = σx /μx. It also frequently refers to the sample coefficient of variation, which is the ratio of the sample standard deviation and sample mean.1
Cogeneration
See: Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation.
Combined heat and power (CHP)
Combined heat and power (CHP), also known as cogeneration, is the simultaneous production of both electricity and useful heat for application by the producer or to be sold to other users with the aim of better utilisation of the energy used. Public utilities may utilise part of the heat produced in power plants and sell it for public heating purposes. Industries as auto-producers may sell part of the excess electricity produced to other industries or to electric utilities.
Comparability
Comparability means that estimates of emissions and removals reported by countries in inventories are comparable among countries. For this purpose, countries should use agreed methodologies and formats for estimating and reporting inventories.
Completeness
Completeness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks and gases included in the IPCC Guidelines for the full geographic coverage in addition to other existing relevant source/sink categories which are specific to individual countries (and therefore may not be included in the IPCC Guidelines).
Confidence
The term ‘confidence’ is used to represent trust in a measurement or estimate. Having confidence in inventory estimates does not make those estimates more accurate or precise; however, it will eventually help to establish a consensus regarding whether the data can be applied to solve a problem. This usage of confidence differs substantially from the statistical usage in the term confidence interval.
Confidence interval
A confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed/estimated data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter. The interval has an associated confidence level that quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies in the interval. Most commonly, the 95 per cent confidence level is used.
Consistency
Consistency means that an inventory is internally consistent in all its elements over a period of years. An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used for the base year and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or removals from sources or sinks. An inventory using different methodologies for different years can be considered to be consistent if it has been estimated in a transparent manner taking into account the guidance in Volume 1 on good practice in time series consistency.
Correlation
Mutual relationship between two quantities. See correlation coefficient.
Correlation coefficient
A number lying between –1 and +1, which measures the mutual relationship between two variables that are observed together. A value of +1 means that the variables have a perfect linear relationship; a value of –1 means that there is a perfect inverse linear relation; and a value of 0 means that there is no straight line relation. It is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations.
Country-specific data
Data for either activities or emission factors that are based on research carried out on sites either in that country or otherwise representative of that country.
1 ‘Coefficient of variation’ is the term, which is frequently replaced by ‘error’ in a statement like ‘the error is 5%’.
Glossary
G.6 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Cruise
(When applied to aircraft) All aircraft activities that take place at altitudes above 914 metres (3,000 feet) including any additional climb or descent operations above this altitude. There is no upper limit.
Dam
An artificial structure that is barrier used to hold back water in a reservoir. Typically constructed with mineral sediment or concrete.
Degassing emissions
Elevated gas emissions that occur as water is released from a dam and experiences sudden changes in pressure, temperature and turbulence. These changes cause air-water exchange processes to occur at much greater rates than in surface waters as the released water approaches a new equilibrium with the environment downstream following Le Chatelier's principle. In the case of dams the change in the hydrostatic pressure before and after water passing through turbines affects this balance.
Also, water released from dams is typically released into a stilling basin designed to dissipate much of the turbulent energy of the flow in order to prevent excessive bank erosion in the natural river channel downstream. The increased water column turbulence greatly increases the air-water gas transfer rate for a given dissolved gas concentration. In some cases, water may be discharged through needle valves into the air, which provides very high air-water contact area leading to rapid gas release.
Decision tree
A decision tree is a flow chart describing the specific ordered steps which need to be followed to develop an inventory or an inventory component in accordance with the principles of good practice.
Denitrification
The microbially facilitated reduction of nitrates or nitrites to molecular nitrogen (N2) through which the nitrogen is emitted from the substrate to the atmosphere.
Diffusive emission
The gas flux across the air-water interface governed by diffusion. For measuring diffusive fluxes, the most popular method employs floating chambers. Frequently estimated using the Thin Boundary Layer model of gas transfer.
Displaced emission
An emission of greenhouse gases that has been relocated in space (and possibly in time) but unchanged in quantity. For example, remineralisation and emission of CO2 of 1 kg of soil C assumed to occur in an agricultural field may actually occur downstream in a river, reservoir or ocean if that 1 kg of soil C is carried into the stream network as a consequence of rainfall. The carbon is still converted to CO2 but enters the atmosphere at a location downstream of the carbon source.
Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)
Sum of all inorganic carbon species in solution (e.g. carbonate, bicarbonate, carbonic acid, carbon dioxide).
Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)
Organic carbon remaining in solution after filtering the sample, typically using a 0.45 micrometre filter.
Distribution function
A distribution function or cumulative distribution function F(x) for a random variable X specifies the probability P(X ≤ x) that X is less than or equal to x.
Ditch
A long, narrow excavation dug in the earth, typically unlined, often with a uniform cross-section. They are most often used to provide drainage alongside roadways and from agricultural fields and to convey water for irrigation.
Downstream emissions
The total greenhouse gas emissions that occur downstream of a dam including both degassing emissions and the diffusive emission.
Drainage channel
A ditch used for drainage.
 G.7
Drawdown zone
The area around the perimeter of a reservoir or pond that is intermittently exposed to the air as a result of water level changes.
Ebullitive emission
The flux of gas carried by bubbles from sediments through to the water column to the atmosphere.
Eddy flux measurement
The measurement of material fluxes by correlating high-frequency turbulent velocity fluctuations with turbulent concentration fluctuations. Also referred to as eddy correlation i.e. micrometeorological method that uses differences in concentration associated with turbulence in the air to quantify net vertical gas exchange.
Emission factor
A coefficient that quantifies the emissions or removals of a gas per unit activity. Emission factors are often based on a sample of measurement data, averaged to develop a representative rate of emission for a given activity level under a given set of operating conditions.
Emissions
The release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time. (UNFCCC Article 1.4)
Energy recovery
A form of resource recovery in which the organic fraction of waste is converted to some form of usable energy. Recovery may be achieved through the combustion of processed or raw refuse to produce steam through the pyrolysis of refuse to produce oil or gas; and through the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes to produce methane gas.
Enhanced coal bed methane (recovery)
Increased CH4 recovery produced by the injection of CO2 into coal seams.
Epilimnetic
Pertaining to the epilimnion of a stratified water body.
Epilimnion
The uppermost region of a density-stratified reservoir. Frequently defined as the region above the strongest temperature gradient in the water column. It always includes, but is not limited to, the surface mixing layer – the isothermal region of actively turbulent water just below the air-water interface.
Estimation
The process of calculating emissions and/or removals.
Eutrophication
Natural or anthropogenic process of nutrient enrichment of a water body which leads to increases in algal biomass.
Evaporative emissions
Evaporative emissions fall within the class of fugitive emissions and are released from area (rather than point) sources. These are often emissions of Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs), and are produced when the product is exposed to the air – for example in the use of paints or solvents.
Excluded carbon
Carbon in non-energy uses of fossil fuels (feed stocks, reductant and non-energy products) excluded from fuel combustion.
Expert judgement
A carefully considered, well-documented qualitative or quantitative judgement made in the absence of unequivocal observational evidence by a person or persons who have a demonstrable expertise in the given field.
Feedstock
Fossil fuels used as raw materials in chemical conversion processes to produce primarily organic chemicals and, to a lesser extent, inorganic chemicals.
Glossary
G.8 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
First use
Distinguishes first uses (and related emissions) from later non-energy uses of fossil fuels. For example, first-use emissions from lubricants are those which take place as a result of oxidation during use as a lubricant. Used lubricants may be used subsequently for heat raising as waste oils.
Flaring
All burning of natural gas/vapour streams and hydrocarbon liquids by flares as a waste disposal option rather than for the production of useful heat or power.
Floating chamber
Closed container that floats on the surface of the water used to quantify greenhouse gas emissions from the water surface. The time-dependent change in gas concentration within the floating chamber is a direct measurement of the gas flux.
Flood control
The operation of a reservoir to reduce peaks in river discharge.
Flow rate
The volume of water or gas passing through an imaginary plane at an instant of time [units are length3 time-1; e.g., m3 s-1, ft3 s-1, ML d-1, Ln min-1].
Fluorocarbons
Halocarbons containing fluorine atoms, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).
Flux
(1) The rate of flow of any liquid or gas, across a given area; the amount of this crossing a given area in a given time. E.g., ""Flux of CO2 absorbed by forests"".
(2) Raw materials, such as limestone, dolomite, lime, and silica sand, which are used to reduce the heat or other energy requirements of thermal processing of minerals (such as the smelting of metals). Fluxes also may serve a dual function as a slagging agent.
Forest Land
This category includes all land with woody vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define Forest Land in the national greenhouse gas inventory. It also includes systems with a vegetation structure that currently fall below, but in situ could potentially reach the threshold values used by a country to define the Forest Land category.
Fossil carbon
Carbon derived from fossil fuel or other fossil source.
Fuel
Any substance burned as a source of energy such as heat or electricity. See also Primary Fuels and Secondary Fuels.
Fuel combustion
Within the Guidelines fuel combustion is the intentional oxidation of materials within an apparatus that is designed to provide heat or mechanical work to a process, or for use away from the apparatus.
Fuel wood
Wood used directly as fuel.
Fugitive Emissions (oil and natural gas systems)
The intentional or unintentional release of greenhouse gases that occur during the exploration, processing and delivery of fossil fuels to the point of final use. This excludes greenhouse gas emissions from fuel combustion for the production of useful heat or power. It encompasses venting, flaring, and leaks.
Funnel trap
A device deployed underwater to capture bubbles.
 G.9
Global warming potential
Global Warming Potentials (GWP) are calculated as the ratio of the radiative forcing of one kilogramme greenhouse gas emitted to the atmosphere to that from one kilogramme CO2 over a period of time (e.g., 100 years).
Good Practice
""Good practice"" is a key concept for inventory compilers to follow in preparing national greenhouse gas inventories. The key concept does not change in the 2019 Refinement. The term ""good practice"" has been defined, since 2000 when this concept was introduced2, as ""a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced so far as practicable"". This definition has gained general acceptance amongst countries as the basis for inventory development and its centrality has been retained for the 2019 Refinement. Certain terms in the definition have been updated based on feedback from the statistics community, such that this definition can be also understood as ""a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and that they are precise so far as practicable"" in the context of refinement of Chapter 3 of Volume 13.
Good Practice covers choice of estimation methods appropriate to national circumstances, quality assurance and quality control at the national level, quantification of uncertainties and data archiving and reporting to promote transparency.
Ground truth
A term used for data obtained by measurements on the ground, usually as validation for remote sensing, e.g., satellite data.
Harvested wood products
Harvested wood products (HWP) according to the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (2003) and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines refer to wood and paper products, and include i) wood products in use (i.e. wood utilised as a material); ii) wood biomass used for energy purposes and iii) wood biomass in solid waste disposal sites.
Hydrocarbon
Strictly defined as molecules containing only hydrogen and carbon. The term is often used more broadly to include any molecules in petroleum which may also contain S, N, or O. An unsaturated hydrocarbon is any hydrocarbon containing olefinic, acetylenic, or aromatic structures.
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)
Halocarbons containing only hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon atoms. Because HCFCs contain chlorine, they contribute to ozone depletion. They are also greenhouse gases.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
Halocarbons containing only hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms. Because HFCs contain no chlorine, bromine, or iodine, they do not deplete the ozone layer. Like other halocarbons, they are potent greenhouse gases.
Hydrofluoroethers (HFEs)
Chemicals composed of hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms, with ether structure. Because HFEs contain no chlorine, bromine, or iodine, they do not deplete the ozone layer. Like other halocarbons, they are potent greenhouse gases.
Hypolimnetic
Pertaining to the hypolimnion.
2 The definition was originally introduced with the Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories published in 2000.
3 In the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the term “uncertainty” was used with two meanings – a general one which is associated with both accuracy and precision, and a specific one only as the inverse of precision. This definition text of “good practice” which uses the term “precise” instead of “uncertainties” overcomes inconsistencies with general IPCC definition for uncertainty, without changing the original concept of “good practice”.
Glossary
G.10 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Hypolimnion
The region of colder water at the bottom of a thermally stratified water body. It lies below the metalimnion (or thermocline) – the region with the strongest temperature gradient – and it may contain a weak temperature gradient. In many reservoirs, the hypolimnion can be anoxic (no oxygen) for many months each year because vertical transport of dissolved gases from above occurs mainly by slow diffusive processes across the metalimnion. This can lead to the accumulation of large concentrations of dissolved CH4 released from the bottom sediments.
Hypoxia
Waterbodies where dissolved oxygen has become undersaturated due to natural and/or anthropogenic processes which have led to aerobic biological oxygen consumption rates greater than the rate of re-oxygenation.
Hypoxic
Depletion of dissolved oxygen in aquatic environments to levels that are detrimental or fatal to aerobic organisms often caused by eutrophication.
Independence
Two random variables are independent if there is a complete absence of association between how their sample values vary. The most commonly used measure of the lack of independence between two random variables is the correlation coefficient.
Inflow, in the context of water bodies
The water that enters a water body (e.g. pond, lake, reservoir). In addition to surface flows (streams, rivers), inflow may also include precipitation and groundwater inputs.
Irrigation channel
An open channel that transports water in order to irrigate agricultural land.
Key category
A key category is one that is prioritised within the national inventory system because its estimate has a significant influence on a country's total inventory of greenhouse gases in terms of the absolute level of emissions and removals, the trend in emissions and removals, or uncertainty in emissions or removals. Whenever the term key category is used, it includes both source and sink categories.
Key source
See key category.
Kilns
A tubular heating apparatus used in the manufacture of cement, lime and other materials. The calcination reaction may take place in the kiln itself, or, where so-equipped, it may partly or completely take place in a preheater and/or precalciner apparatus ahead of the kiln.
Land cover
Refers to the bio-physical coverage of land (e.g., bare soil, rocks, forests, buildings and roads or lakes).
Land use
A broad classification of land based on the activities and cover, and in this report refers specifically to six general types including Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements and Other Land. Note that a specific parcel of land may have more than one land use, but it is generally the predominant land use that forms the basis for the classification. The land-uses may be considered as top-level categories for representing all land-use areas, with sub-divisions describing specific circumstances significant to emissions estimation.
Landfill gas
Municipal solid waste contains significant portions of organic materials that produce a variety of gaseous products when deposited, compacted, and covered in landfills. Anaerobic bacteria thrive in the oxygen-free environment, resulting in the decomposition of the organic materials and the production of primarily carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon dioxide is likely to leach out of the landfill because it is soluble in water. Methane, on the other hand, which is less soluble in water and lighter than air, is likely to migrate directly to the atmosphere.
 G.11
Large dams
A dam with a height of 15 metres or greater from lowest foundation to crest or a dam between 5 metres and 15 metres impounding more than 3 million cubic metres. (See International Commission On Large Dams Constitution, Page 3)
LTO (landing and take-off) cycle
All aircraft activities that occur under 914 metres (3 000 feet) including idling aircraft engines, taxi-out, take-off, climb up to 914 metres, descend, approach and taxi-in. Note: some gatherers of statistics count either single take-off or landing as one cycle; however, it is both one take-off and one landing that together define the LTO cycle.
Lubricants
Lubricants are hydrocarbons produced from distillate or residue, and they are mainly used to reduce friction between bearing surfaces. This category includes all finished grades of lubricating oil, from spindle oil to cylinder oil, and those used in greases, including motor oils and all grades of lubricating oil base stocks.
Managed land
Land where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions. All land definitions and classifications should be specified at the national level, described in a transparent manner, and be applied consistently over time. Therefore, what is not defined as ‘managed land’ by a country should be classified as unmanaged.
Managed Land Proxy (MLP)
For the AFOLU Sector, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals by sinks are defined as all those occurring on ‘managed land’. This approach, i.e., the use of managed land as a proxy for anthropogenic effects, was adopted in the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (2003) and that use is maintained in the 2019 Refinement.
Manure
Waste materials produced by domestic livestock (vegetative material such as green manures are considered to be crop residues or compost). The term ‘manure’ is used here collectively to include both dung and urine (i.e., the solids and the liquids) produced by livestock.
Mean
The mean is a value around which values sampled from a probability distribution tend to lie. The sample mean or arithmetic average is an estimator for the mean. It is an unbiased and consistent estimator of the population mean (expected value) and is itself a random variable with its own variance value. The sample mean is the sum of values divided by the number of values:
Σ=niixnx1 (xi, where i = 1,…., n are items of a sample).
Measurement-based approach
The use of direct measurements to compute GHG fluxes from a system.
Median
The median or population median is a value which divides the integral of a probability density function (PDF) into two halves. For symmetric PDFs, it equals the mean. The median is the 50th population percentile.
The sample median is an estimator of the population median. It is the value that divides an ordered sample into two equal halves. If there are 2n + 1 observations, the median is taken as the (n + 1)th member of the ordered sample. If there are 2n, it is taken as being halfway between the nth and (n + 1)th.
Methanogenic production
Production of methane by microorganisms (methanogenic bacteria) during the decomposition of organic matter.
Glossary
G.12 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Mode
The mode of a distribution is the value which has the highest probability of occurrence. Distributions can have one or more modes. In practice, distributions with only one mode are usually encountered. In this case, the mode or population mode of a PDF is the measure of a value around which values sampled from a probability distribution tend to lie.
The sample mode is an estimator for the population mode calculated by subdividing the sample range into equal subclasses, counting how many observations fall into each class and selecting the centre point of the class (or classes) with the greatest number of observations.
Model
A model is a quantitatively-based or qualitatively-based abstraction of a real-world situation which may simplify or neglect certain features to better focus on its more important elements.
Example: the relationship that emissions equal an emission factor times an activity level is a simple model. The term ‘model’ is also often used in the sense of a computer software realisation of a model abstraction.
Model-based approach
The application of (typically) statistical or process-based models that employ indirect measurements to infer GHG fluxes from a system of interest. For example, a model-based estimate of a pollutant flux could be computed as the product of an assumed concentration and a measured flow rate, whereas the corresponding measurement-based estimate would use a measured concentration and a measured flow rate.
Monte Carlo method
In these Guidelines a Monte Carlo method is recommended to analyse the uncertainty of the inventory. The principle of Monte Carlo analysis is to perform the inventory calculation many times by computer, each time with the uncertain emission factors or model parameters and activity data chosen randomly (by the computer) within the distribution on uncertainties specified initially by the user. Uncertainties in emission factors and/or activity data are often large and may not have normal distributions. In this case the conventional statistical rules for combining uncertainties become very approximate. Monte Carlo analysis can deal with this situation by generating an uncertainty distribution for the inventory estimate that is consistent with the input uncertainty distributions on the emission factors, model parameters and activity data.
Non-energy products
Primary or secondary fossil fuels which are used directly for their physical or diluent properties. Examples are: lubricants, paraffin waxes, bitumen, and white spirits and mineral turpentine (as solvent).
Non-energy use
Within the Guidelines this term refers to the use of fossil fuels as Feedstock, Reductant or Non-energy products. However, the use of this term differs between countries and sources of energy statistics. In most energy statistics, e.g., of the International Energy Agency (IEA), fuel inputs of reductants to blast furnaces are not included but accounted for as inputs to a fuel conversion activity transforming coke and other inputs to blast furnace gas.
Non-marketed lime production
Lime production occurring at facilities where the primary purpose is the production of lime as an intermediate input: such as plants that produce steel, synthetic soda ash, calcium carbide, magnesia and magnesium metal, as well as copper smelter and sugar mills. The lime produced by these facilities is often used on site and thus is often not reported in national statistics. Also referred to as in-house lime production.
Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs)
A class of emissions which includes a wide range of specific organic chemical substances. Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) play a major role in the formation of ozone in the troposphere (lower atmosphere). Ozone in the troposphere is a greenhouse gas. It is also a major local and regional air pollutant, causing significant health and environmental damage. Because they contribute to ozone formation, NMVOCs are considered ""precursor"" greenhouse gases. NMVOCs, once oxidized in the atmosphere, produce carbon dioxide.
 G.13
Normal distribution
The normal (or Gaussian) distribution has the probability density function (PDF) given in the following equation and is defined by two parameters (the mean μ and the standard σ deviation).
∞≤≤∞=−−xexfx-for ,21)(222) (σμπσ.
Nutrient loading
An increase in levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur entering aquatic systems as a result of human activity occurring in the catchment.
Observational data
Observational data is empirical data from instrumental (usually monitoring equipment) or manual methods (through counts in a survey or census).
Off-gas
The exhaust gas from a chemical process (combustion or non-combustion). The off gas may be vented to the atmosphere, burned for energy recovery or flared (without energy recovery), or used as a feedstock for another chemical process. Secondary products may also be recovered from the off gas.
Open burning of waste
The combustion of unwanted combustible materials such as paper, wood, plastics, textiles, rubber, and other debris in the open or at an open dump site, where smoke and other emissions are released directly into the air without passing through a chimney or stack. Open burning can also include incineration devices that do not control the combustion air to maintain an adequate temperature and do not provide sufficient residence time for complete combustion.
Outflow, in the context of reservoirs
Water discharged from a dam.
Outflow area
The area where water is discharged immediate downstream of a dam. It is characterised by exceptionally high levels of turbulence in the water (see degassing emissions) that directly result from the operation of the dam.
Oxic
Containing dissolved oxygen.
Oxidation
Chemically transform of a substance by combining it with oxygen.
Oxycline
The region of high dissolved oxygen concentration change within the water column that separates oxic and anoxic regions.
Ozone-depleting substances (ODS)
A compound that contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion. Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) include CFCs, HCFCs, halons, methyl bromide, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform. ODS are generally very stable in the troposphere and only degrade under intense ultraviolet light in the stratosphere. When they break down, they release chlorine or bromine atoms, which then deplete ozone.
Pasture
Area covered with grass or other plants used or suitable for the grazing of livestock; grassland.
PDF
See Probability density function.
Peat
Soft, porous or compressed, sedimentary deposit of plant origin with high water content in the natural state (up to about 90 percent). Countries may define peat according to their national circumstances.
Glossary
G.14 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Peatland
Peatlands are wetland ecosystems where soils are dominated by peat. In peatlands net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition as a result of waterlogged conditions, which leads to the accumulation of peat.
Percentile
A percentile (or a centile) is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
Synthetically produced halocarbons containing only carbon and fluorine atoms. They are characterized by extreme stability, non-flammability, low toxicity, zero ozone depleting potential, and high global warming potential.
Plant-mediated emission
Flows of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere that are influenced by plants, and such as the production, transport and oxidation of methane in wetland soils.
Polar/boreal, dry climate
Regions where mean annual temperature (MAT) is less than or equal to 0 oC, and the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration is less than or equal to 1.
Polar/boreal, moist climate
Regions where mean annual temperature (MAT) is less than or equal to 0 oC, and the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration is greater than 1.
Ponds
The water impounded behind a small dam (< 15 m high) or embankment.
Pool, carbon and nitrogen
A reservoir in the Earth system where elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, reside in various chemical forms for a period of time. An example is carbon and nitrogen pools in forest biomass, which are composed of various types of compounds synthesized by trees. A group of pools are linked in a cycle with flows among the pools influenced by both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic processes.
An example is carbon and nitrogen pools in forest biomass, wood products, dead organic matter, soils and the atmosphere, in which flows are influenced by non-anthropogenic drivers such as plant production and microbial decomposition, as well as anthropogenic drivers such as fertilization, land use, tree harvest and product use. The units are in mass.
Population
The population is the totality of items under consideration. In the case of a random variable, the probability distribution is considered to define the population of that variable.
Precision
Closeness of agreement between independent results of measurements obtained under stipulated conditions. Better precision means less random error.
Primary fuels
Fuels which are extracted directly from natural resources. Examples are: crude oil, natural gas, coals, etc.
Process-based modelling
A mathematical modelling approach based on a theoretical understanding of fundamental ecological, biological, chemical, and physical processes. Typically using differential equations to represent the change over time of parameters of interest, it provides a useful framework to project specific responses to altered environmental conditions. For example, a process-based model might be used to quantify the delivery of organic matter delivered from the catchment and/or produced by primary production within a reservoir, its deposition onto a reservoir's sediment, the degradation of the organic matter aerobically to CO2 or anaerobically to CH4 over time, and the emission of these gases across the air-water interface.
 G.15
Probability
The probability of an event is a measure of the likelihood that the event will occur. The probability of any event can range from 0 to 1. The sum of probabilities of all sample points in a sample space is equal to 1.
Probability density function
A probability density function (PDF) is a function, whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample.
Probability distribution
Statistical definition: A function giving the probability that a random variable takes any given value or belongs to a given set of values. The probability on the whole set of values of the random variable equals 1.
Process emissions
Emissions from industrial processes involving chemical transformations other than combustion.
Pumped storage reservoirs
Reservoirs at different elevations that are used to store energy by moving water from the lower to the higher elevation.
Quality Assurance
Quality Assurance (QA) activities include a planned system of review procedures conducted by personnel not directly involved in the inventory compilation/development process to verify that data quality objectives were met, ensure that the inventory represents the best possible estimate of emissions and sinks given the current state of scientific knowledge and data available, and support the effectiveness of the quality control (QC) programme.
Quality Control
Quality Control (QC) is a system of routine technical activities, to measure and control the quality of the inventory as it is being developed. The QC system is designed to:
(i) Provide routine and consistent checks to ensure data integrity, correctness, and completeness;
(ii) Identify and address errors and omissions;
(iii) Document and archive inventory material and record all QC activities.
QC activities include general methods such as accuracy checks on data acquisition and calculations and the use of approved standardised procedures for emission calculations, measurements, estimating uncertainties, archiving information and reporting. More detailed QC activities include technical reviews of source categories, activity and emission factor data, and methods.
RAMSAR
The Convention on Wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources.
Removals
Removal of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors from the atmosphere by a sink.
Reporting
The process of providing results of the inventory as described in Volume 1 Chapter 8.
Reservoir
(1) A component or components of the climate system where a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored. (UNFCCC Article 1.7)
(2) Water bodies regulated for human activities (energy production, irrigation, navigation, recreation etc.) where substantial changes in water area due to water level regulation may occur. The water impounded behind a dam.
(3) In the context of oil and natural gas systems, an underground formation where oil and gas has accumulated; consists of porous or fractured rock that holds oil and gas and a cap rock that prevents its escape.
Glossary
G.16 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Rice paddies
A flooded parcel of land used for growing semiaquatic rice. Paddy cultivation should not be confused with cultivation of deep water rice, which is grown in flooded conditions with water more than 50 cm (20 in) deep for at least a month.
River emissions
GHG emissions from the surface of a normally (in a hydraulic sense) flowing river downstream of the exceptionally turbulent region (see outflow area) immediately downstream of a dam. ‘Normal flow’ refers to the velocity of the flow being solely determined by channel shape and bed slope so that water column turbulence is produced predominantly by natural shear forces at the water-river bed interface.
Run-of-the-river reservoirs
Reservoirs in hydroelectric systems that harvest the energy from flowing water to generate electricity but cannot store more water than one day's annual mean inflow (i.e. annual mean flow / 365).
Secchi depth
A practical measure of aquatic turbidity (versus clarity) based on the depth at which a standard Secchi disc (created by Angelo Secchi) ceases to be visible from the surface of the water body.
Secondary fuels
Fuels manufactured from primary fuels. Examples are: cokes, motor gasoline and coke oven gas, blast furnace gas.
Sink
Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. (UNFCCC Article 1.8) Notation in the final stages of reporting is the negative (-) sign.
Soil carbon pool
A pool of carbon comprised of soil organic matter that is smaller than 2mm in size.
Source
Any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. (UNFCCC Article 1.9) Notation in the final stages of reporting is the positive (+) sign.
Spillway
An engineered channel used to pass high flows safely past a dam when the reservoir water level is higher than the crest of the dam. Note that the maximum water level of a reservoir is frequently higher than the crest because of the use of gates that are on top of the crest.
Standard deviation
The population standard deviation is the positive square root of the variance. It is estimated by the sample standard deviation that is the positive square root of the sample variance.
Storage volume
The volume of water stored in a water body. The ‘active’ storage of a reservoir is the volume of water contained between the full supply level (the maximum level at which water may be stored indefinitely) and the lowest outlet level. The ‘dead’ storage is the volume of water that is below the lowest outlet and therefore cannot be routinely accessed for beneficial use. The ‘flood control’ storage is the volume of water contained between the full supply level and the top of gates (or other adjustable structures) located on top of the spillway and used to regulate the discharge of floodwaters. The total reservoir storage volume is the sum of dead storage, active storage, and flood control storage capacities.
Surrogate data
Surrogate data or so-called proxy data is data that is used in place of the actual data, where the specific data needed is unobtainable. Often surrogate data is needed to describe changes in an emission source over time, for example population change may be used to approximate change in waste arisings.
Survey
A survey is an investigation about the characteristics of a given population by means of collecting data from a sample of that population and estimating their characteristics through the systematic use of statistical methodology.
 G.17
Systematic and random errors
Systematic error (i.e., bias) is the difference between the true, but usually unknown, value of a quantity being estimated, and the mean observed value as would be estimated by the sample mean of an infinite set of observations. The random error of an individual measurement is the difference between an individual measurement and the above limiting value of the sample mean.
Systematic error
See systematic and random errors.
Temperate, cold dry climate
Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is between 0 – 10 oC, and the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration is less than or equal to 1.
Temperate, cold moist climate
Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is between 0 – 10 oC, and the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration is greater than 1.
Temperate, warm dry climate
Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is between 10 – 18 oC (or greater than 18 oC with more than 7 days of frost per year), and the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration is less than or equal to 1.
Temperate, warm moist climate
Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is between 10 – 18 oC (or greater than 18 oC with more than 7 days of frost per year), and the ratio of mean annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration is greater than 1.
Thin boundary layer model
The thin boundary layer model expresses the flux of gas across an air-water interface as the product of a gas transfer velocity and the concentration change across the interface. It was originally developed by Liss and Slater (1974).
Tier
A tier represents a level of methodological complexity. Usually three tiers are provided. Tier 1 is the basic method, Tier 2 intermediate and Tier 3 most demanding in terms of complexity and data requirements. Tiers 2 and 3 are sometimes referred to as higher tier methods and are generally considered to be more accurate.
Time series
A time series is series of values which are affected by random processes and which are observed at successive (usually equidistant) points in time.
Transparency
Transparency means that the assumptions and methodologies used for an inventory should be clearly explained to facilitate replication and assessment of the inventory by users of the reported information. The transparency of inventories is fundamental to the success of the process for the communication and consideration of information.
Trend
The trend of a quantity measures its change over a time period, with a positive trend value indicating growth in the quantity, and a negative value indicating a decrease. It is defined as the ratio of the change in the quantity over the time period, divided by the initial value of the quantity, and is usually expressed either as a percentage or a fraction.

Trophic state
A measure of the biological productivity of a water body. It is usually characterized by some combination of nutrients, photosynthetic pigments (Chl-a) and/or water column optical properties. As the ambient nutrient levels increase, primary production (the algal population) increases and the water clarity decreases. As primary production increases, higher levels of biological production are supported and the trophic state increases.
Lakes or reservoirs are usually classified as being in one of four possible trophic states: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, or hypereutrophic. (see e.g., Carlson, 1977)
Oligotrophic: an oligotrophic lake or reservoir is characterised by low primary productivity, as a result of low nutrient content. (Chl-a ≤ 2.6 μg L-1.)
Mesotrophic: mesotrophic lakes or reservoirs are characterised with an intermediate level of productivity (2.6 μg L-1 < Chl-a ≤ 20 μg L-1.)
Eutrophic: a eutrophic lake, pond or reservoir with high biological productivity. Due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, these water bodies are able to support an abundance of aquatic plants. (20 μg L-1 < Chl-a ≤ 56 μg L-1.)
Hypereutrophic: a hypereutrophic body of water experiences the highest levels of biological productivity. (56 μg L-1 < Chl-a)
Tropical, dry climate
Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and mean annual precipitation less than or equal to 1000mm.
Tropical, moist climate
Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and mean annual precipitation greater than 1000mm and less than or equal to 2000mm.
Tropical montane climate
Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and an elevation greater than 1000m.
Tropical, wet climate
Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and mean annual precipitation greater than 2000mm.
Unbiased estimator
An unbiased estimator is a statistic whose expected value equals the value of the parameter being estimated. Note that this term has a specific statistical meaning and that an estimate of a quantity calculated from an unbiased estimator may lack bias in the statistical sense, but may be biased in the more general sense of the word if the sample has been affected by unknown systematic error. Thus, in statistical usage, a biased estimator can be understood as a deficiency in the statistical evaluation of the collected data, and not in the data themselves or in the method of their measurement or collection. For example, the arithmetic mean (average) x is an unbiased estimator of the expected value (mean).
Uncertainty
Lack of knowledge of the true value of a variable that can be described as a probability density function characterizing the range and likelihood of possible values. Uncertainty depends on the analyst’s state of knowledge, which in turn depends on the quality and quantity of applicable data as well as knowledge of underlying processes and inference methods. (See Volume 1 Chapter 3.)
Uncertainty analysis
An uncertainty analysis of a model aims to provide quantitative measures of the uncertainty of output values caused by uncertainties in the model itself and in its input values, and to examine the relative importance of these factors.
Validation
Validation is the establishment of sound approach and foundation. In the context of emission inventories, validation involves checking to ensure that the inventory has been compiled correctly in line with reporting instructions and guidelines. It checks the internal consistency of the inventory. The legal use of validation is to give an official confirmation or approval of an act or product.
 G.19
Variability
This refers to observed differences attributable to true heterogeneity or diversity in a population. Variability derives from processes which are either inherently random or whose nature and effects are influential but unknown. Variability is not usually reducible by further measurement or study, but can be characterised by quantities such as the sample variance.
Verification
Verification refers to the collection of activities and procedures that can be followed during the planning and development, or after completion of an inventory that can help to establish its reliability for the intended applications of that inventory.
Typically, methods external to the inventory are used to check the truth of the inventory, including comparisons with estimates made by other bodies or with emission and uptake measurements determined from atmospheric concentrations or concentration gradients of these gases.
Watercourse
The channel that a flowing body of water follows.
Water residence time
The average amount of time that water spends in a particular system (lake, reservoir, etc.). Defined as the volume of the reservoir divided by the inflow.
Water withdrawal
The controlled release of water from a dam. Depending on the dam’s design, i.e. the number and level of discrete outlets, the withdrawn water may originate solely from specific regions of the water column, i.e. epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion. The withdrawal region for a specific discharge depends strongly on the density stratification of the water body, the outlet dimensions, and the reservoir morphology.
Wetlands
This category includes land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the year (e.g., peatland) and that does not fall into the forest land, cropland, grassland or settlements categories. The category can be subdivided into managed and unmanaged according to national definitions. Wetlands occur over all climate zones and include reservoirs and other constructed waterbodies (e.g. agriculture and aquaculture ponds, canals and ditches and wetlands constructed for wastewater treatment) as managed sub-divisions. Managed wetlands may also include peatlands, riparian wetlands, forested swamps, marshes, playas, pans, salt lakes, brackish wetlands, salinas, and sabkhas, in addition to coastal wetlands, including mangroves, saltmarshes, tidal marshes and seagrass. Unmanaged wetlands include natural rivers, lakes and ponds and any wetlands that have not been directly modified by human activity based on the Managed Land Proxy."

.5°C pathway See Pathways.
Agenda for Sustainable Development A UN resolution
in September 2015 adopting a plan of action for people, planet and
prosperity in a new global development framework anchored in 17
Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015).
Acceptability of policy or system change The extent to
which a policy or system change is evaluated unfavourably or
favourably, or rejected or supported, by members of the general
public (public acceptability) or politicians or governments (political
acceptability). Acceptability may vary from totally unacceptable/fully
rejected to totally acceptable/fully supported; individuals may differ
in how acceptable policies or system changes are believed to be.
Acclimatisation A change in functional or morphological traits
occurring once or repeatedly (e.g., seasonally) during the lifetime
of an individual organism in its natural environment. Through
acclimatisation the individual maintains performance across a range
of environmental conditions. For a clear differentiation between
findings in laboratory and field studies, the term acclimation is used
in ecophysiology for the respective phenomena when observed in
well-defined experimental settings. The term (adaptive) plasticity
characterises the generally limited scope of changes in phenotype
that an individual can reach through the process of acclimatisation.
Activity A practice or ensemble of practices that take place on
a delineated area over a given period of time.
Activity data Data on the magnitude of a human activity resulting
in emissions or removals taking place during a given period of time. In
the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, data on
area of different land uses, management systems, animal numbers,
lime and fertiliser use are examples of activity data.
Adaptability See Adaptive capacity.
Adaptation In human systems, the process of adjustment to
actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm
or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, the process of
adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may
facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.
Incremental adaptation
Adaptation that maintains the essence and integrity of a system or
process at a given scale (Park et al., 2012).
Transformational adaptation
Adaptation that changes the fundamental attributes of a socialecological
system in anticipation of climate change and its impacts.
Adaptation limits
The point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be
secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions.
• Hard adaptation limit: No adaptive actions are possible to avoid
intolerable risks.
• Soft adaptation limit: Options are currently not available to
avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action.
See also Adaptation options, Adaptive capacity and Maladaptive
actions (Maladaptation).
Adaptation behaviour See Human behaviour.
Adaptation limits See Adaptation.
Adaptation options The array of strategies and measures
that are available and appropriate for addressing adaptation. They
include a wide range of actions that can be categorised as structural,
institutional, ecological or behavioural. See also Adaptive capacity,
and Maladaptive actions (Maladaptation).
Adaptation pathways See Pathways
Adaptive capacity The ability of systems, institutions, humans
and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage
of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (IPCC, 2014; MA,
). See also Adaptation, Adaptation options, and Maladaptive
actions (Maladaptation).
Adaptive governance See Governance.
Adverse side-effect The negative effects that a policy or
measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives,
without yet evaluating the net effect on overall social welfare.
Adverse side-effects are often subject to uncertainty and depend on,
among others, local circumstances and implementation practices. See
also Co-benefits and Risk.
Aerosol A suspension of airborne solid or liquid particles, with
a typical size between a few nanometres and 10 μm that reside in the
atmosphere for at least several hours. The term aerosol, which includes
both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report
in its plural form to mean aerosol particles. Aerosols may be of either
natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may influence climate in
several ways: through both interactions that scatter and/or absorb
radiation and through interactions with cloud microphysics and other
cloud properties, or upon deposition on snow or ice covered surfaces
thereby altering their albedo and contributing to climate feedback.
Atmospheric aerosols, whether natural or anthropogenic, originate
from two different pathways: emissions of primary particulate matter
(PM), and formation of secondary PM from gaseous precursors. The
bulk of aerosols are of natural origin. Some scientists use group
labels that refer to the chemical composition, namely: sea salt,
organic carbon, black carbon (BC), mineral species (mainly desert
dust), sulphate, nitrate, and ammonium. These labels are, however,
imperfect as aerosols combine particles to create complex mixtures.
See also Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF).
Afforestation Conversion to forest of land that historically has
not contained forests. [Note: For a discussion of the term forest and
related terms such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, in
the context of reporting and accounting Article 3.3 and 3.4 activities
under the Kyoto Protocol, see 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods
and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol.] See
also Reforestation, Deforestation, Forest and Reducing Emissions
from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
Agreement In this report, the degree of agreement within the
scientific body of knowledge on a particular finding is assessed
based on multiple lines of evidence (e.g., mechanistic understanding,
theory, data, models, expert judgement) and expressed qualitatively
(Mastrandrea et al., 2010). See also Confidence, Likelihood,
and Uncertainty.

Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) In the
context of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories under the
United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), AFOLU is
the sum of the GHG inventory sectors Agriculture and Land Use, Land-
Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF); see the 2006 IPCC Guidelines
for National GHG Inventories for details. Given the difference in
estimating the ‘anthropogenic’ carbon dioxide (CO2) removals
between countries and the global modelling community, the landrelated
net GHG emissions from global models included in this report
are not necessarily directly comparable with LULUCF estimates in
national GHG Inventories.
FOLU (Forestry and Other Land Use) – also referred to as LULUCF
The subset of AFOLU emissions and removals of greenhouse gases
(GHGs) resulting from direct human-induced land use, land-use
change, and forestry activities excluding agricultural emissions.
See also Land-Use Change (LUC) and Land Use, Land-Use Change and
Forestry (LULUCF).
Agrobiodiversity ‘The variety and variability of animals, plants
and micro-organisms that are used directly or indirectly for food
and agriculture, including crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries.
It comprises the diversity of genetic resources (varieties, breeds)
and species used for food, fodder, fibre, fuel and pharmaceuticals.
It also includes the diversity of non-harvested species that support
production (soil micro-organisms, predators, pollinators), and those
in the wider environment that support agro-ecosystems (agricultural,
pastoral, forest and aquatic) as well as the diversity of the agroecosystems’
(FAO, 2005).
Agroecology ‘The science and practice of applying ecological
concepts, principles and knowledge (i.e., the interactions of, and
explanations for, the diversity, abundance and activities of organisms)
to the study, design and management of sustainable agroecosystems.
It includes the roles of human beings as a central organism in
agroecology by way of social and economic processes in farming
systems. Agroecology examines the roles and interactions among
all relevant biophysical, technical and socioeconomic components of
farming systems and their surrounding landscapes’ (IPBES, 2019).
Agroforestry Collective name for land-use systems and
technologies where woody perennials (trees, shrubs, palms,
bamboos, etc.) are deliberately used on the same land-management
units as agricultural crops and/or animals, in some form of spatial
arrangement or temporal sequence. In agroforestry systems there
are both ecological and economical interactions between the
different components. Agroforestry can also be defined as a dynamic,
ecologically based, natural resource management system that,
through the integration of trees on farms and in the agricultural
landscape, diversifies and sustains production for increased social,
economic and environmental benefits for land users at all levels
(FAO, 2015a).
Air pollution Degradation of air quality with negative effects
on human health, the natural or built environment, due to the
introduction by natural processes or human activity in the atmosphere
of substances (gases, aerosols) which have a direct (primary
pollutants) or indirect (secondary pollutants) harmful effect. See also
Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF).
Albedo The proportion of sunlight (solar radiation) reflected by
a surface or object, often expressed as a percentage. Clouds, snow
and ice usually have high albedo; soil surfaces cover the albedo range
from high to low; vegetation in the dry season and/or in arid zones
can have high albedo, whereas photosynthetically active vegetation
and the ocean have low albedo. The Earth’s planetary albedo changes
mainly through varying cloudiness, snow, ice, leaf area and land
cover changes.
Ambient persuasive technology Technological systems
and environments that are designed to change human cognitive
processing, attitudes and behaviours without the need for the user’s
conscious attention.
Anomaly The deviation of a variable from its value averaged over
a reference period. See also Reference period.
Anthromes ‘Human systems, with natural ecosystems
embedded within them’ (Ellis and Ramankutty 2008). The anthrome
classification system is based on human population density and land
use, and comprises the following classes: dense settlements, villages,
croplands, rangeland, forested (then broadened to seminatural) and
wildlands (Ellis et al. 2010).
Anthropocene A proposed new geological epoch resulting from
significant human-driven changes to the structure and functioning of
the Earth System, including the climate system. Originally proposed
in the Earth System science community in 2000, the proposed new
epoch is undergoing a formalisation process within the geological
community based on the stratigraphic evidence that human activities
have changed the Earth System to the extent of forming geological
deposits with a signature that is distinct from those of the Holocene,
and which will remain in the geological record. Both the stratigraphic
and Earth System approaches to defining the Anthropocene consider
the mid-20th century to be the most appropriate starting date,
although others have been proposed and continue to be discussed.
The Anthropocene concept has been taken up by a diversity of
disciplines and the public to denote the substantive influence humans
have had on the state, dynamics and future of the Earth System. See
also Holocene.
Anthropogenic Resulting from or produced by human activities.
See also Anthropogenic emissions, and Anthropogenic removals.
Anthropogenic emissions Emissions of greenhouse gases
(GHGs), precursors of GHGs and aerosols caused by human activities.
These activities include the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, land
use and land-use changes (LUC), livestock production, fertilisation,
waste management, and industrial processes. See also Anthropogenic,
and Anthropogenic removals.
Anthropogenic removals The withdrawal of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human
activities. These include enhancing biological sinks of CO2 and using
chemical engineering to achieve long term removal and storage.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from industrial and energy-related
sources, which alone does not remove CO2 from the atmosphere,
can help reduce atmospheric CO2 if it is combined with bioenergy
production (BECCS). [Note: In the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
GHG Inventories, which are used in reporting of emissions to the
UNFCCC, 'anthropogenic’ land-related GHG fluxes are defined as all


those occurring on 'managed land’, i.e. ‘where human interventions
and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or
social functions’. However, some removals (e.g. removals associated
with CO2 fertilisation and N deposition) are not considered as
‘anthropogenic’, or are referred to as ‘indirect’ anthropogenic
effects, in some of the scientific literature assessed in this report. As
a consequence, the land-related net GHG emission estimates from
global models included in this report are not necessarily directly
comparable with LULUCF estimates in national GHG Inventories.
See also Anthropogenic emissions, Bioenergy with carbon dioxide
capture and storage (BECCS), Carbon dioxide capture and storage
(CCS) and Land use, Land-use change, and Forestry (LULUCF).
Aridity The state of a long-term climatic feature characterised
by low average precipitation or available water in a region. Aridity
generally arises from widespread persistent atmospheric subsidence
or anticyclonic conditions, and from more localised subsidence
in the lee side of mountains (adapted from Gbeckor-Kove, 1989;
Türkeş, 1999).
Atmosphere The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth, divided
into five layers — the troposphere which contains half of the Earth’s
atmosphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere, the thermosphere,
and the exosphere, which is the outer limit of the atmosphere. The
dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume
mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together
with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93 % volume mixing
ratio), helium and radiatively active greenhouse gases (GHGs) such
as carbon dioxide (CO2) (0.04% volume mixing ratio) and ozone (O3).
In addition, the atmosphere contains the GHG water vapour (H2O),
whose amounts are highly variable but typically around 1% volume
mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and aerosols. See
also Carbon dioxide (CO2), Ozone (O3), Troposphere, Stratosphere,
Greenhouse gas (GHG), and Hydrological cycle.
Atmosphere-ocean general circulation model
(AOGCM) See Climate model.
Atmospheric boundary layer The atmospheric layer adjacent
to the Earth’s surface that is affected by friction against that boundary
surface, and possibly by transport of heat and other variables across
that surface (AMS, 2000). The lowest 100 m of the boundary layer
(about 10% of the boundary layer thickness), where mechanical
generation of turbulence is dominant, is called the surface boundary
layer or surface layer.
Attribution See Detection and attribution.
Baseline scenario In much of the literature the term is also
synonymous with the term business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, although
the term BAU has fallen out of favour because the idea of business
as usual in century-long socio-economic projections is hard to
fathom. In the context of transformation pathways, the term baseline
scenarios refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that
no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond
those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to
be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions
of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve
to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further
policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to
mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals
for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, atmospheric concentrations
or temperature change. The term baseline scenario is often used
interchangeably with reference scenario and no policy scenario. See
also Emission scenario, and Mitigation scenario.
Biochar Relatively stable, carbon-rich material produced by
heating biomass in an oxygen-limited environment. Biochar is
distinguished from charcoal by its application: biochar is used as
a soil amendment with the intention to improve soil functions and
to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from biomass that would
otherwise decompose rapidly (IBI, 2018).
Biodiversity Biodiversity or biological diversity means the
variability among living organisms from all sources including, among
other things, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the
ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity
within species, between species and of ecosystems (UN, 1992). See
also Ecosystem, and Ecosystem service.
Bioenergy Energy derived from any form of biomass or its
metabolic by-products. See also Biomass and Biofuel.
Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage
(BECCS) Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology
applied to a bioenergy facility. Note that depending on the total
emissions of the BECCS supply chain, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be
removed from the atmosphere. See also Bioenergy, and Carbon
dioxide capture and storage (CCS).
Biofuel A fuel, generally in liquid form, produced from biomass.
Biofuels include bioethanol from sugarcane, sugar beet or maize, and
biodiesel from canola or soybeans. See also Biomass, and Bioenergy.
Biogeochemical effects Processes through which land affects
climate, excluding biophysical effects. These processes include
changes in net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards the
atmosphere, net emissions of aerosols (mineral and organic), ozone
deposition on ecosystems, and net emissions of biogenic volatile
organic compounds (BVOCs) and their subsequent changes in
atmospheric chemistry. See also Biophysical effects.
Biomass Organic material excluding the material that is fossilised
or embedded in geological formations. Biomass may refer to the mass
of organic matter in a specific area (ISO, 2014). See also Bioenergy,
and Biofuel.
Traditional biomass
The combustion of wood, charcoal, agricultural residues and/or
animal dung for cooking or heating in open fires or in inefficient
stoves as is common in low-income countries.
Biome 'Global-scale zones, generally defined by the type of plant
life that they support in response to average rainfall and temperature
patterns. For example, tundra, coral reefs or savannas’ (IPBES, 2019).
Biophysical effects The range of physical processes through
which land affects climate. These processes include changes in
hydrology (e.g. water vapor fluxes at the land/atmosphere interface),
heat exchanges via convective fluxes (latent and sensible), radiation
(solar and infra-red, absorbed and emitted), and momentum (e.g.
affecting wind speed).

Black carbon (BC) A relatively pure form of carbon, also known
as soot, arising from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels,
biofuel, and biomass. It stays in the atmosphere only for days or
weeks. Black carbon is a climate forcing agent with strong warming
effect, both in the atmosphere and when deposited on snow or ice.
See also Atmosphere, and Aerosol.
Blue carbon All biologically-driven carbon fluxes and storage
in marine systems that are amenable to management can be
considered as blue carbon. Coastal blue carbon focuses on rooted
vegetation in the coastal zone, such as tidal marshes, mangroves and
seagrasses. These ecosystems have high carbon burial rates on a per
unit area basis and accumulate carbon in their soils and sediments.
They provide many non-climatic benefits and can contribute to
ecosystem-based adaptation. If degraded or lost, coastal blue carbon
ecosystems are likely to release most of their carbon back to the
atmosphere. There is current debate regarding the application of the
blue carbon concept to other coastal and non-coastal processes and
ecosystems, including the open ocean. See also Ecosystem services,
and Carbon sequestration.
Business as usual (BAU) See Baseline scenario.
Carbon budget Refers to three concepts in the literature:
(1) an assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global
level, through the synthesis of evidence for fossil-fuel and cement
emissions, land-use change emissions, ocean and land CO2 sinks,
and the resulting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) growth rate.
This is referred to as the global carbon budget; (2) the estimated
cumulative amount of global carbon dioxide emissions that that is
estimated to limit global surface temperature to a given level above
a reference period, taking into account global surface temperature
contributions of other greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate forcers;
(3) the distribution of the carbon budget defined under (2) to the
regional, national, or sub-national level based on considerations of
equity, costs or efficiency. See also Remaining carbon budget.
Carbon cycle The flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as carbon
dioxide (CO2), carbon in biomass, and carbon dissolved in the ocean
as carbonate and bicarbonate) through the atmosphere, hydrosphere,
terrestrial and marine biosphere and lithosphere. In this report, the
reference unit for the global carbon cycle is GtCO2 or GtC (one
Gigatonne = 1 Gt = 1015 grams; 1GtC corresponds to 3.667 GtCO2).
Carbon dioxide (CO2) A naturally occurring gas, CO2 is also a byproduct
of burning fossil fuels (such as oil, gas and coal), of burning
biomass, of land-use changes (LUC) and of industrial processes (e.g.,
cement production). It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas
(GHG) that affects the Earth’s radiative balance. It is the reference gas
against which other GHGs are measured and therefore has a Global
Warming Potential (GWP) of 1. See also Greenhouse gas (GHG), Land
use, and Land-use change.
Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) A process in
which a relatively pure stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial
and energy-related sources is separated (captured), conditioned,
compressed and transported to a storage location for long-term
isolation from the atmosphere. Sometimes referred to as Carbon
Capture and Storage. See also Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation
(CCU), Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS),
and Sequestration.
Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU) A process in
which carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured and then used to produce a
new product. If the CO2 is stored in a product for a climate-relevant
time horizon, this is referred to as carbon dioxide capture, utilisation
and storage (CCUS). Only then, and only combined with CO2 recently
removed from the atmosphere, can CCUS lead to carbon dioxide
removal. CCU is sometimes referred to as Carbon dioxide capture and
use. See also Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).
Carbon dioxide capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) See
Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU).
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) Anthropogenic activities
removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and durably
storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products.
It includes existing and potential anthropogenic enhancement of
biological or geochemical sinks and direct air capture and storage,
but excludes natural CO2 uptake not directly caused by human
activities. See also Mitigation (of climate change), Greenhouse gas
removal (GGR), Negative emission technologies, and Sink.
Carbon intensity The amount of emissions of carbon dioxide
(CO2) released per unit of another variable such as gross domestic
product (GDP), output energy use or transport.
Carbon price The price for avoided or released carbon dioxide
(CO2) or CO2-equivalent emissions. This may refer to the rate of
a carbon tax, or the price of emission permits. In many models that
are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are
used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies.
See also Mitigation.
Carbon sequestration The process of storing carbon in a carbon
pool. See also Blue carbon, Carbon dioxide capture and storage
(CCS), Uptake, and Sink.
Carbon sink See Sink.
Carbon stock The quantity of carbon in a carbon pool. See also
Pool, carbon and nitrogen.
Citizen science A voluntary participation of the public in the
collection and/or processing of data as part of a scientific study
(Silvertown, 2009).
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) A mechanism defined
under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol through which investors
(governments or companies) from developed (Annex B) countries
may finance greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction or removal
projects in developing countries (Non-Annex B), and receive Certified
Emission Reduction Units (CERs) for doing so. The CERs can be credited
towards the commitments of the respective developed countries.
The CDM is intended to facilitate the two objectives of promoting
sustainable development (SD) in developing countries and of helping
industrialised countries to reach their emissions commitments in
a cost-effective way.
Climate Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the
average weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in
terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period


of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The
classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined
by the World Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities
are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation
and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical
description, of the climate system.
Climate change A change in the state of the climate that can be
identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/
or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended
period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to
natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations
of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic
changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note
that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of
climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity
that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is
in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable
time periods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate
change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric
composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes.
See also Climate variability, Global warming, Ocean acidification, and
Detection and attribution.
Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event) The
occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above (or
below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the
range of observed values of the variable. For simplicity, both extreme
weather events and extreme climate events are referred to collectively
as ‘climate extremes.’ See also Extreme weather event.
Climate feedback An interaction in which a perturbation in
one climate quantity causes a change in a second and the change
in the second quantity ultimately leads to an additional change in
the first. A negative feedback is one in which the initial perturbation
is weakened by the changes it causes; a positive feedback is one in
which the initial perturbation is enhanced. The initial perturbation
can either be externally forced or arise as part of internal variability.
Climate governance See Governance.
Climate model A numerical representation of the climate
system based on the physical, chemical and biological properties
of its components, their interactions and feedback processes and
accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system
can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for
any one component or combination of components a spectrum or
hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as
the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical,
chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the
level at which empirical parametrizations are involved. There is an
evolution towards more complex models with interactive chemistry
and biology. Climate models are applied as a research tool to study
and simulate the climate and for operational purposes, including
monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions. See also Earth
system model (ESM).
Climate projection Simulated response of the climate system
to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) and aerosols, and changes in land use, generally
derived using climate models. Climate projections are distinguished
from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/
concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is in turn based
on assumptions concerning, for example, future socioeconomic and
technological developments that may or may not be realised.
Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs)
Trajectories that strengthen sustainable development and efforts to
eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting fair and
cross-scalar adaptation to and resilience in a changing climate. They
raise the ethics, equity, and feasibility aspects of the deep societal
transformation needed to drastically reduce emissions to limit global
warming (e.g., to 2°C) and achieve desirable and liveable futures and
well-being for all.
Climate-resilient pathways Iterative processes for managing
change within complex systems in order to reduce disruptions and
enhance opportunities associated with climate change. See also
Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs), Development
pathways, Pathways, and Transformation pathways.
Climate sensitivity The change in the annual global mean
surface temperature in response to a change in the atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration or other radiative forcing.
Equilibrium climate sensitivity
An estimate of the global mean surface temperature response to
a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration
that is evaluated from model output or observations for evolving
non-equilibrium conditions. It is a measure of the strengths of the
climate feedbacks at a particular time and may vary with forcing
history and climate state, and therefore may differ from equilibrium
climate sensitivity.
Transient climate response
The change in the global mean surface temperature, averaged over
a 20-year period, centred at the time of atmospheric carbon dioxide
(CO2) doubling, in a climate model simulation in which CO2 increases
at 1% yr–1 from pre-industrial. It is a measure of the strength of
climate feedbacks and the timescale of ocean heat uptake.
See also Climate model, and Global mean surface temperature
(GMST).
Climate services Information and products that enhance users’
knowledge and understanding about the impacts of climate change
and/or climate variability so as to aid decision-making of individuals
and organisations and enable preparedness and early climate change
action. Such services involve high-quality data from national and
international databases on temperature, rainfall, wind, soil moisture
and ocean conditions, as well as maps, risk and vulnerability
analyses, assessments, and long-term projections and scenarios.
Depending on the user’s needs, these data and information products
may be combined with non-meteorological data, such as agricultural
production, health trends, population distributions in high-risk areas,
road and infrastructure maps for the delivery of goods, and other
socio-economic variables (WMO, 2019).
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) An approach to agriculture
that aims to transform and reorient agricultural systems to effectively
support development and ensure food security in a changing climate

by: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes;
adapting and building resilience to climate change; and reducing and/
or removing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible (FAO, 2018).
Climate system The system consisting of five major components:
the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the lithosphere and
the biosphere and the interactions between them. The climate system
evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics
and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar
variations, orbital forcing, and anthropogenic forcings such as the
changing composition of the atmosphere and land-use change.
Climate target A temperature limit, concentration level,
or emissions reduction goal used towards the aim of avoiding
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For
example, national climate targets may aim to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by a certain amount over a given time horizon, for example
those under the Kyoto Protocol.
Climate variability Variations in the mean state and other
statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes,
etc.) of the climate on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that
of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural
internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or
to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external
variability). See also Climate change.
CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) emission The amount of carbon
dioxide (CO2) emission that would cause the same integrated
radiative forcing or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as
an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a mixture of GHGs.
There are a number of ways to compute such equivalent emissions
and choose appropriate time horizons. Most typically, the CO2-
equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG
by its Global Warming Potential (GWP) for a 100 year time horizon.
For a mix of GHGs it is obtained by summing the CO2-equivalent
emissions of each gas. CO2-equivalent emission is a common scale
for comparing emissions of different GHGs but does not imply
equivalence of the corresponding climate change responses. There
is generally no connection between CO2-equivalent emissions and
resulting CO2-equivalent concentrations.
CO2 fertilisation The enhancement of plant growth as a result
of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration.
The magnitude of CO2 fertilisation depends on nutrients and
water availability.
Co-benefits The positive effects that a policy or measure aimed
at one objective might have on other objectives, thereby increasing
the total benefits for society or the environment. Co-benefits are
often subject to uncertainty and depend on local circumstances
and implementation practices, among other factors. Co-benefits are
also referred to as ancillary benefits. See also Adverse side-effects,
and Risk.
Collective action A number of people working together
voluntarily to achieve some common objective (Meinzen-Dick and Di
Gregorio, 2004).
Conference of the Parties (COP) The supreme body of UN
conventions, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), comprising parties with a right to vote
that have ratified or acceded to the convention. See also United
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
Confidence The robustness of a finding based on the type,
amount, quality and consistency of evidence (e.g., mechanistic
understanding, theory, data, models, expert judgment) and on the
degree of agreement across multiple lines of evidence. In this report,
confidence is expressed qualitatively (Mastrandrea et al., 2010). See
also Likelihood, and Uncertainty.
Convection Vertical motion driven by buoyancy forces arising
from static instability, usually caused by near-surface cooling or
increases in salinity in the case of the ocean and near-surface warming
or cloud-top radiative cooling in the case of the atmosphere. In the
atmosphere, convection gives rise to cumulus clouds and precipitation
and is effective at both scavenging and vertically transporting
chemical species. In the ocean, convection can carry surface waters
to deep within the ocean.
Coping capacity The ability of people, institutions, organisations,
and systems, using available skills, values, beliefs, resources, and
opportunities, to address, manage, and overcome adverse conditions
in the short to medium term. (UNISDR, 2009; IPCC, 2012a). See
also Resilience.
Cost-benefit analysis Monetary assessment of all negative
and positive impacts associated with a given action. Cost-benefit
analysis enables comparison of different interventions, investments
or strategies and reveal how a given investment or policy effort pays
off for a particular person, company or country. Cost-benefit analyses
representing society’s point of view are important for climate
change decision making, but there are difficulties in aggregating
costs and benefits across different actors and across timescales. See
also Discounting.
Cost-effectiveness A measure of the cost at which a policy
goal or outcome is achieved. The lower the cost the greater the
cost effectiveness.
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) A climate
modelling activity from the World Climate Research Programme
(WCRP) which coordinates and archives climate model simulations
based on shared model inputs by modelling groups from around
the world. The CMIP3 multi-model data set includes projections
using SRES scenarios. The CMIP5 data set includes projections using
the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The CMIP6
phase involves a suite of common model experiments as well as an
ensemble of CMIP-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs).
Cumulative emissions The total amount of emissions released
over a specified period of time. See also Carbon budget.
Decarbonisation Process by which countries, individuals or other
entities aim to achieve zero fossil carbon existence. Typically refers
to a reduction of the carbon emissions associated with electricity,
industry and transport.
Decoupling Decoupling (in relation to climate change) is where
economic growth is no longer strongly associated with consumption
of fossil fuels. Relative decoupling is where both grow but at different


rates. Absolute decoupling is where economic growth happens but
fossil fuels decline.
Deforestation Conversion of forest to non-forest. [Note: For
a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation,
reforestation and deforestation in the context of reporting and
accounting Article 3.3 and 3.4 activities under the Kyoto Protocol, see
Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance
Arising from the Kyoto Protocol.] See also Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
Deliberative governance See Governance.
Demand and supply-side measures
Demand-side measures
Policies and programmes for influencing the demand for goods and/
or services. In the energy sector, demand-side management aims
at reducing the demand for electricity and other forms of energy
required to deliver energy services.
Supply-side measures
Policies and programmes for influencing how a certain demand for
goods and/or services is met. In the energy sector, for example, supplyside
mitigation measures aim at reducing the amount of greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions emitted per unit of energy produced.
See also Mitigation measures.
Demand-side measures See Demand and supply-side measures.
Desertification Land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid
areas resulting from many factors, including climatic variations
and human activities (UNCCD, 1994).
Detection See Detection and attribution.
Detection and attribution Detection of change is defined
as the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected
by climate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without
providing a reason for that change. An identified change is detected
in observations if its likelihood of occurrence by chance due to
internal variability alone is determined to be small, for example,
<10%. Attribution is defined as the process of evaluating the relative
contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with
a formal assessment of confidence.
Development pathways See Pathways.
Diet ‘The kinds of food that follow a particular pattern that
a person or community eats’ (FAO, 2014). See also Dietary patterns.
Dietary patterns The quantities, proportions, variety or
combinations of different foods and beverages in diets, and the
frequency with which they are habitually consumed (Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2015). See also Diet.
Dietary and nutrition transitions Modernisation,
urbanisation, economic development, and increased wealth lead to
predictable shifts in diet, referred to as ‘nutrition transitions’ (Misra
and Khurana, 2008; Popkin, 2006). Over historical time there have
been a number of dietary transitions but in recent decades the
prime transition has been associated with changes from subsistence
towards eating diets rich in calories and relatively poor in nutrition
(the ‘westernised diet’) that are obesogenic. From a public health
perspective, a new dietary transition is in focus, from the obesogenic
diet to one promoting health.
Disaster A ‘serious disruption of the functioning of a community
or a society at any scale due to hazardous events interacting with
conditions of exposure, vulnerability and capacity, leading to one or
more of the following: human, material, economic and environmental
losses and impacts’ (UNISDR, 2017). See also Exposure, Risk,
Vulnerability and Hazard.
Disaster risk management (DRM) Processes for designing,
implementing, and evaluating strategies, policies, and measures
to improve the understanding of current and future disaster risk,
foster disaster risk reduction and transfer, and promote continuous
improvement in disaster preparedness, prevention and protection,
response, and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose of
increasing human security, well-being, quality of life, and sustainable
development (UNISDR, 2017).
Discounting A mathematical operation that aims to make
monetary (or other) amounts received or expended at different
times (years) comparable across time. The discounter uses a fixed
or possibly time-varying discount rate from year to year that makes
future value worth less today (if the discount rate is positive). The
choice of discount rate(s) is debated as it is a judgement based on
hidden and/or explicit values.
Discount rate See Discounting.
(Internal) Displacement The forced movement of people
within the country they live in. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are
‘Persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee
or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as
a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations
of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or
human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally
recognized State border’ (UN, 1998). See also Migration.
Displacement In land system science, displacement denotes the
increasing spatial separation between the location of agricultural
and forestry production and the place of consumption of these
products, as it occurs with trade. Displacement disconnects spatially
environmental impacts from their socioeconomic drivers.
Downscaling Method that derives local- to regional-scale (up to
km) information from larger-scale models or data analyses. Two
main methods exist: dynamical downscaling and empirical/statistical
downscaling. The dynamical method uses the output of regional
climate models, global models with variable spatial resolution, or
high-resolution global models. The empirical/statistical methods [are
based on observations and] develop statistical relationships that link
the large-scale atmospheric variables with local/ regional climate
variables. In all cases, the quality of the driving model remains an
important limitation on quality of the downscaled information. The
two methods can be combined, e.g., applying empirical/statistical
downscaling to the output of a regional climate model, consisting of
a dynamical downscaling of a global climate model.
Drainage ‘Artificial lowering of the soil water table’ (IPCC, 2013).
See also Rewetting.

Glossary Annex I
AI
Drought A period of abnormally dry weather long enough
to cause a serious hydrological imbalance. Drought is a relative
term, therefore any discussion in terms of precipitation deficit
must refer to the particular precipitation-related activity that is
under discussion. For example, shortage of precipitation during the
growing season impinges on crop production or ecosystem function
in general (due to soil moisture drought, also termed agricultural
drought), and during the runoff and percolation season primarily
affects water supplies (hydrological drought). Storage changes in
soil moisture and groundwater are also affected by increases in
actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions in precipitation.
A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined as
a meteorological drought.
Megadrought
A very lengthy and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than
normal, usually a decade or more.
Early warning systems (EWS) The set of technical, financial
and institutional capacities needed to generate and disseminate
timely and meaningful warning information to enable individuals,
communities and organisations threatened by a hazard to prepare
to act promptly and appropriately to reduce the possibility of harm
or loss. Dependent upon context, EWS may draw upon scientific and/
or Indigenous knowledge. EWS are also considered for ecological
applications e.g., conservation, where the organisation itself is not
threatened by hazard but the ecosystem under conservation is
(an example is coral bleaching alerts), in agriculture (for example,
warnings of ground frost, hailstorms) and in fisheries (storm and
tsunami warnings) (UNISDR, 2009; IPCC, 2012a).
Earth system feedbacks See Climate feedback.
Earth system model (ESM) A coupled atmosphere–ocean
general circulation model in which a representation of the carbon
cycle is included, allowing for interactive calculation of atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO2) or compatible emissions. Additional components
(e.g., atmospheric chemistry, ice sheets, dynamic vegetation, nitrogen
cycle, but also urban or crop models) may be included. See also
Climate model.
Ecological cascade A series of secondary extinctions as a result
of the extinction of a key species within an ecosystem (Soulé, 2010).
Ecosystem A functional unit consisting of living organisms, their
non-living environment and the interactions within and between
them. The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial
boundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is
defined: in some cases they are relatively sharp, while in others they
are diffuse. Ecosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems
are nested within other ecosystems and their scale can range from
very small to the entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems
either contain people as key organisms, or are influenced by the effects
of human activities in their environment. See also Ecosystem services.
Ecosystem services Ecological processes or functions having
monetary or non-monetary value to individuals or society at large.
These are frequently classified as (1) supporting services such as
productivity or biodiversity maintenance, (2) provisioning services
such as food or fibre, (3) regulating services such as climate regulation
or carbon sequestration, and (4) cultural services such as tourism or
spiritual and aesthetic appreciation. See also Ecosystem.
Effective climate sensitivity See Climate sensitivity.
Effective radiative forcing See Radiative forcing.
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) The term El Niño was
initially used to describe a warm-water current that periodically flows
along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. It has
since become identified with warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean
east of the dateline. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation
of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern
called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere–ocean
phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven
years, is known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is often
measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti
and Darwin and/or the sea surface temperatures in the central and
eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade
winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such
that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade
winds. This phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, sea surface
temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has
climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts
of the world, through global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO
is called La Niña.
Embodied (embedded) [emissions, water, land] The total
emissions [water use, land use] generated [used] in the production
of goods and services regardless of the location and timing of those
emissions [water use, land use] in the production process. This
includes emissions [water use, land use] within the country used
to produce goods or services for the country’s own use, but also
includes the emissions [water use, land use] related to the production
of such goods or services in other countries that are then consumed
in another country through imports. Such emissions [water, land]
are termed ‘embodied’ or ‘embedded’ emissions, or in some cases
(particularly with water) as ‘virtual water use’ (David and Caldeira,
; Allan, 2005; MacDonald et al., 2015).
Emission scenario A plausible representation of the future
development of emissions of substances that are radiatively active
(e.g., greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols) based on a coherent and
internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces (such as
demographic and socio-economic development, technological change,
energy and land use) and their key relationships. Concentration
scenarios, derived from emission scenarios, are often used as

Pathways (RCPs) (under Pathways), Shared socio-economic pathways
(SSPs) (under Pathways), Scenario, Socio-economic scenario, and
Transformation pathway.
Emission trajectories A projected development in time of the
emission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or group of GHGs, aerosols, and
GHG precursors. See also Pathways.
Energy access Access to clean, reliable and affordable energy
services for cooking and heating, lighting, communications, and
productive uses (with special reference to Sustainable Development
Goal 7) (AGECC, 2010). See also Traditional biomass.


Enabling conditions (for adaptation and mitigation
options) Conditions that affect the feasibility of adaptation
and mitigation options, and can accelerate and scale-up systemic
transitions that would limit temperature increase and enhance
capacities of systems and societies to adapt to the associated climate
change, while achieving sustainable development, eradicating
poverty and reducing inequalities. Enabling conditions include
finance, technological innovation, strengthening policy instruments,
institutional capacity, multi-level governance, and changes in human
behaviour and lifestyles. They also include inclusive processes,
attention to power asymmetries and unequal opportunities for
development and reconsideration of values.
Energy efficiency The ratio of output or useful energy or energy
services or other useful physical outputs obtained from a system,
conversion process, transmission or storage activity to the input
of energy (measured as kWh kWh–1, tonnes kWh–1 or any other
physical measure of useful output like tonne-km transported). Energy
efficiency is often described by energy intensity. In economics,
energy intensity describes the ratio of economic output to energy
input. Most commonly energy efficiency is measured as input energy
over a physical or economic unit, i.e. kWh USD–1 (energy intensity),
kWh tonne–1. For buildings, it is often measured as kWh m–2, and
for vehicles as km liter–1or liter km–1. Very often in policy ‘energy
efficiency’ is intended as the measures to reduce energy demand
through technological options such as insulating buildings, more
efficient appliances, efficient lighting, efficient vehicles, etc.
Energy security The goal of a given country, or the global
community as a whole, to maintain an adequate, stable and
predictable energy supply. Measures encompass safeguarding the
sufficiency of energy resources to meet national energy demand at
competitive and stable prices and the resilience of the energy supply;
enabling development and deployment of technologies; building
sufficient infrastructure to generate, store and transmit energy
supplies and ensuring enforceable contracts of delivery.
Enhanced weathering Enhancing the removal of carbon
dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through dissolution of silicate
and carbonate rocks by grinding these minerals to small particles
and actively applying them to soils, coasts or oceans.
(Model) Ensemble A group of parallel model simulations
characterising historical climate conditions, climate predictions, or
climate projections. Variation of the results across the ensemble
members may give an estimate of modelling-based uncertainty.
Ensembles made with the same model but different initial conditions
only characterise the uncertainty associated with internal climate
variability, whereas multi-model ensembles including simulations
by several models also include the impact of model differences.
Perturbed parameter ensembles, in which model parameters are
varied in a systematic manner, aim to assess the uncertainty resulting
from internal model specifications within a single model. Remaining
sources of uncertainty unaddressed with model ensembles are
related to systematic model errors or biases, which may be assessed
from systematic comparisons of model simulations with observations
wherever available. See also Climate projection.
Equality A principle that ascribes equal worth to all human beings,
including equal opportunities, rights, and obligations, irrespective
of origins.
Inequality
Uneven opportunities and social positions, and processes of
discrimination within a group or society, based on gender,
class, ethnicity, age, and (dis)ability, often produced by uneven
development. Income inequality refers to gaps between highest and
lowest income earners within a country and between countries. See
also Equity and Fairness.
Equilibrium climate sensitivity See Climate sensitivity.
Equity The principle of being fair and impartial, and a basis for
understanding how the impacts and responses to climate change,
including costs and benefits, are distributed in and by society in more
or less equal ways. It is often aligned with ideas of equality, fairness
and justice and applied with respect to equity in the responsibility
for, and distribution of, climate impacts and policies across society,
generations, and gender, and in the sense of who participates and
controls the processes of decision making.
Distributive equity
Equity in the consequences, outcomes, costs and benefits of actions
or policies. In the case of climate change or climate policies for
different people, places and countries, including equity aspects of
sharing burdens and benefits for mitigation and adaptation.
Gender equity
Equity between women and men with regard to their rights,
resources and opportunities. In the case of climate change, gender
equity recognises that women are often more vulnerable to the
impacts of climate change and may be disadvantaged in the process
and outcomes of climate policy.
Inter-generational equity
Equity between generations. In the context of climate change, intergenerational
equity acknowledges that the effects of past and present
emissions, vulnerabilities and policies impose costs and benefits for
people in the future and of different age groups.
Procedural equity
Equity in the process of decision making including recognition and
inclusiveness in participation, equal representation, bargaining
power, voice and equitable access to knowledge and resources
to participate.
See also Equality and Fairness.
Evaporation The physical process by which a liquid (e.g., water)
becomes a gas (e.g., water vapour).
Evapotranspiration The combined processes through which
water is transferred to the atmosphere from open water and ice
surfaces, bare soil, and vegetation that make up the Earth’s surface.
Potential Evapotranspiration
The potential rate of water loss without any limits imposed by the
water supply. See also Evaporation.
Evidence Data and information used in the scientific process to
establish findings. In this report, the degree of evidence reflects the
amount, quality, and consistency of scientific/technical information

on which the Lead Authors base their findings. See also Agreement,
Confidence, Likelihood, and Uncertainty.
Exposure The presence of people; livelihoods; species or
ecosystems; environmental functions, services, and resources;
infrastructure; or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and
settings that could be adversely affected. See also Hazard, Risk,
and Vulnerability.
Extratropical Cyclone Any cyclonic-scale storm that is not
a tropical cyclone. Usually refers to a middle- or high-latitude
migratory storm system formed in regions of large horizontal
temperature variations. Sometimes called extratropical storm or
extratropical low. See also Tropical cyclone.
Extreme weather or climate event See Climate extreme
(extreme weather or climate event).
Extreme weather event An event that is rare at a particular
place and time of year. Definitions of ‘rare’ vary, but an extreme
weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th
or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from
observations. By definition, the characteristics of what is called
extreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute sense.
When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as
a season, it may be classed as an extreme climate event, especially
if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., drought
or heavy rainfall over a season). See also Heat wave, and Climate
extreme (extreme weather or climate event).
Fairness Impartial and just treatment without favouritism or
discrimination in which each person is considered of equal worth
with equal opportunity. See also Equity, and Equality.
Feasibility The degree to which climate goals and response
options are considered possible and/or desirable. Feasibility
depends on geophysical, ecological, technological, economic, social
and institutional conditions for change. Conditions underpinning
feasibility are dynamic, spatially variable, and may vary between
different groups. See also Enabling conditions.
Feedback See Climate feedback.
Flexible governance See Governance.
Flood The overflowing of the normal confines of a stream or other
body of water, or the accumulation of water over areas that are not
normally submerged. Floods include river (fluvial) floods, flash floods,
urban floods, rain (pluvial) floods, sewer floods, coastal floods, and
glacial lake outburst floods.
Flux A movement (a flow) of matter (e.g., water vapor, particles),
heat or energy from one place to another, or from one medium (e.g.,
land surface) to another (e.g., atmosphere).
Food loss and waste ‘The decrease in quantity or quality
of food’. Food waste is part of food loss and refers to discarding
or alternative (non-food) use of food that is safe and nutritious
for human consumption along the entire food supply chain, from
primary production to end household consumer level. Food waste is
recognised as a distinct part of food loss because the drivers that
generate it and the solutions to it are different from those of food
losses (FAO, 2015b).
Food security A situation that exists when all people, at all times,
have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and
nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences
for an active and healthy life (FAO, 2001). [Note: Whilst the term
‘food security’ explicitly includes nutrition within it ‘dietary needs …
for an active and healthy life’, in the past the term has sometimes
privileged the supply of calories (energy), especially to the hungry.
Thus, the term ‘food and nutrition security’ is often used (with the
same definition as food security) to emphasise that the term food
covers both energy and nutrition (FAO, 2009).]
Food system All the elements (environment, people, inputs,
processes, infrastructures, institutions, etc.) and activities that
relate to the production, processing, distribution, preparation and
consumption of food, and the output of these activities, including
socio-economic and environmental outcomes (HLPE, 2017). [Note:
Whilst there is a global food system (encompassing the totality of
global production and consumption), each location’s food system is
unique, being defined by that place’s mix of food produced locally,
nationally, regionally or globally.]
Forcing See Radiative forcing.
Forest A vegetation type dominated by trees. Many definitions
of the term forest are in use throughout the world, reflecting
wide differences in biogeophysical conditions, social structure and
economics. [Note: For a discussion of the term forest in the context of
National GHG inventories, see the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
GHG Inventories and information provided by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 2019).] See
also Afforestation, Deforestation, and Reforestation.
Fossil fuels Carbon-based fuels from fossil hydrocarbon deposits,
including coal, oil, and natural gas.
Framework Convention on Climate Change See United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Gender equity See Equity.
Glacier A perennial mass of ice, and possibly firn and snow,
originating on the land surface by the recrystallisation of snow and
showing evidence of past or present flow. A glacier typically gains
mass by accumulation of snow, and loses mass by melting and ice
discharge into the sea or a lake if the glacier terminates in a body of
water. Land ice masses of continental size (>50 000 km2) are referred
to as ice sheets.
Global climate model (also referred to as general circulation
model, both abbreviated as GCM) See Climate model.
Global mean surface temperature (GMST) Estimated
global average of near-surface air temperatures over land and
sea-ice, and sea surface temperatures over ice-free ocean regions,
with changes normally expressed as departures from a value over a
specified reference period. When estimating changes in GMST, nearsurface
air temperature over both land and oceans are also used. See
also Global mean surface air temperature (GSAT), Land surface air
temperature, and Sea surface temperature (SST).


Global mean surface air temperature (GSAT) Global average
of near-surface air temperatures over land and oceans. Changes
in GSAT are often used as a measure of global temperature change in
climate models but are not observed directly. See also Global mean
surface temperature (GMST), and Land surface air temperature.
Global warming An increase in global mean surface temperature
(GMST) averaged over a 30-year period, or the 30-year period centred
on a particular year or decade, expressed relative to pre-industrial
levels unless otherwise specified. For 30-year periods that span past
and future years, the current multi-decadal warming trend is assumed
to continue. See also Climate change, and Climate variability.
Governance A comprehensive and inclusive concept of the full
range of means for deciding, managing, implementing and monitoring
policies and measures. Whereas government is defined strictly in
terms of the nation-state, the more inclusive concept of governance
recognises the contributions of various levels of government (global,
international, regional, sub-national and local) and the contributing
roles of the private sector, of nongovernmental actors, and of civil
society to addressing the many types of issues facing the global
community, and the local context where the effectiveness of policies
and measures are determined.
Adaptive governance
An emerging term in the literature for the evolution of formal
and informal institutions of governance that prioritise planning,
implementation and evaluation of policy through iterative social
learning; in the context of climate change, governance facilitating
social learning to steer the use and protection of natural resources,
and ecosystem services, particularly in situations of complexity
and uncertainty.
Climate governance
Purposeful mechanisms and measures aimed at steering social
systems towards preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the risks
posed by climate change (Jagers and Stripple, 2003).
Deliberative governance
Involves decision making through inclusive public conversation
which allows opportunity for developing policy options through
public discussion rather than collating individual preferences through
voting or referenda (although the latter governance mechanisms can
also be proceeded and legitimated by public deliberation processes).
Flexible governance
Strategies of governance at various levels, which prioritise the use
of social learning and rapid feedback mechanisms in planning and
policy making, often through incremental, experimental and iterative
management processes.
Governance capacity
The ability of governance institutions, leaders, and non-state and
civil society to plan, co-ordinate, fund, implement, evaluate and
adjust policies and measures over the short, medium and long term,
adjusting for uncertainty, rapid change and wide ranging impacts
and multiple actors and demands.
Multi-level governance
Negotiated, non-hierarchical exchanges between institutions at the
transnational, national, regional and local levels.
Participatory governance
A governance system that enables direct public engagement in
decision-making using a variety of techniques for example, referenda,
community deliberation, citizen juries or participatory budgeting. The
approach can be applied in formal and informal institutional contexts
from national to local, but is usually associated with devolved
decision making (Fung and Wright, 2003; Sarmiento and Tilly, 2018).
Governance capacity See Governance.
Grazing land The sum of rangelands and pastures not considered
as cropland, and subject to livestock grazing or hay production. It
includes a wide range of ecosystems, e.g. systems with vegetation
that fall below the threshold used in the forest land category,
silvo-pastoral systems, as well as natural, managed grasslands
and semideserts.
Green infrastructure The interconnected set of natural and
constructed ecological systems, green spaces and other landscape
features. It includes planted and indigenous trees, wetlands, parks,
green open spaces and original grassland and woodlands, as well
as possible building and street level design interventions that
incorporate vegetation. Green infrastructure provides services and
functions in the same way as conventional infrastructure (Culwick
and Bobbins, 2016).
Greenhouse gas (GHG) Gaseous constituents of the atmosphere,
both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at
specific wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation
emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere itself, and by clouds.
This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H2O),
carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone
(O3) are the primary GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover, there
are a number of entirely human-made GHGs in the atmosphere,
such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing
substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O
and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the GHGs sulphur hexafluoride
(SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).
Greenhouse gas removal (GGR) Withdrawal of a greenhouse
gas (GHG) and/or a precursor from the atmosphere by a sink. See also
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and Negative emissions.
Gross domestic product (GDP) The sum of gross value added,
at purchasers’ prices, by all resident and non-resident producers in
the economy, plus any taxes and minus any subsidies not included
in the value of the products in a country or a geographic region for a
given period, normally one year. GDP is calculated without deducting
for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of
natural resources.
Halocarbons A collective term for the group of partially
halogenated organic species, which includes the chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), halons, methyl chloride and methyl bromide. Many of the
halocarbons have large Global Warming Potentials. The chlorine and
bromine-containing halocarbons are also involved in the depletion of
the ozone layer.
Hazard The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced
physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other

Glossary Annex I
AI
health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure,
livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental
resources. See also Disaster, Exposure, Risk, and Vulnerability.
Heatwave A period of abnormally hot weather. Heatwaves and
warm spells have various and in some cases overlapping definitions.
See also Extreme weather event.
Holocene The current interglacial geological epoch, the second of
two epochs within the Quaternary period, the preceding being the
Pleistocene. The International Commission on Stratigraphy defines
the start of the Holocene at 11,700 years before 2000 (ICS, 2019).See
also Anthropocene.
Human behaviour The way in which a person acts in response
to a particular situation or stimulus. Human actions are relevant
at different levels, from international, national, and sub-national
actors, to NGO, firm-level actors, and communities, households, and
individual actions.
Adaptation behaviour
Human actions that directly or indirectly affect the risks of climate
change impacts.
Mitigation behaviour
Human actions that directly or indirectly influence mitigation.
Human behavioural change A transformation or modification
of human actions. Behaviour change efforts can be planned in ways
that mitigate climate change and/or reduce negative consequences
of climate change impacts.
Human rights Rights that are inherent to all human beings,
universal, inalienable, and indivisible, typically expressed and
guaranteed by law. They include the right to life, economic, social, and
cultural rights, and the right to development and self-determination
(based upon the definition by the UN Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights).
Procedural rights
Rights to a legal procedure to enforce substantive rights.
Substantive rights
Basic human rights, including the right to the substance of being
human such as life itself, liberty and happiness.
Human security A condition that is met when the vital core of
human lives is protected, and when people have the freedom and
capacity to live with dignity. In the context of climate change, the
vital core of human lives includes the universal and culturally specific,
material and non-material elements necessary for people to act on
behalf of their interests and to live with dignity.
Human system Any system in which human organisations
and institutions play a major role. Often, but not always, the term
is synonymous with society or social system. Systems such as
agricultural systems, urban systems, political systems, technological
systems, and economic systems are all human systems in the sense
applied in this report.
Hydrological cycle The cycle in which water evaporates from the
oceans and the land surface, is carried over the Earth in atmospheric
circulation as water vapour, condenses to form clouds, precipitates
as rain or snow, which on land can be intercepted by trees and
vegetation, potentially accumulating as snow or ice, provides runoff
on the land surface, infiltrates into soils, recharges groundwater,
discharges into streams, and ultimately, flows out into the oceans
as rivers, polar glaciers and ice sheets, from which it will eventually
evaporate again. The various systems involved in the hydrological
cycle are usually referred to as hydrological systems.
Ice sheet An ice body originating on land that covers an area of
continental size, generally defined as covering >50,000 km2. An ice
sheet flows outward from a high central ice plateau with a small
average surface slope. The margins usually slope more steeply, and
most ice is discharged through fast flowing ice streams or outlet
glaciers, often into the sea or into ice shelves floating on the sea.
There are only two ice sheets in the modern world, one on Greenland
and one on Antarctica. The latter is divided into the East Antarctic Ice
Sheet (EAIS), the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and the Antarctic
Peninsula ice sheet. During glacial periods there were other ice
sheets. See also Glacier.
Impacts (consequences, outcomes) The consequences of
realised risks on natural and human systems, where risks result
from the interactions of climate-related hazards (including extreme
weather and climate events), exposure, and vulnerability. Impacts
generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, health and well-being,
ecosystems and species, economic, social and cultural assets, services
(including ecosystem services), and infrastructure. Impacts may be
referred to as consequences or outcomes, and can be adverse or
beneficial. See also Adaptation, Exposure, Hazard, Loss and Damage,
and losses and damages, and Vulnerability.
(climate change) Impact assessment The practice of
identifying and evaluating, in monetary and/or non-monetary terms,
the effects of climate change on natural and human systems.
Incremental adaptation See Adaptation.
Indigenous knowledge The understandings, skills and
philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction
with their natural surroundings. For many Indigenous peoples,
Indigenous knowledge informs decision-making about fundamental
aspects of life, from day-to-day activities to longer term actions. This
knowledge is integral to cultural complexes, which also encompass
language, systems of classification, resource use practices, social
interactions, values, ritual and spirituality. These distinctive ways
of knowing are important facets of the world’s cultural diversity.
(UNESCO, 2018). See also Local knowledge.
Indirect land-use change See Land-use change.
Industrial revolution A period of rapid industrial growth with
far-reaching social and economic consequences, beginning in Britain
during the second half of the 18th century and spreading to Europe
and later to other countries including the United States. The invention
of the steam engine was an important trigger of this development.
The industrial revolution marks the beginning of a strong increase
in the use of fossil fuels, initially coal, and hence emission of carbon
dioxide (CO2). See also Pre-industrial.
Industrialised/developed/developing countries There are
a diversity of approaches for categorising countries on the basis of
their level of economic development, and for defining terms such


as industrialised, developed, or developing. Several categorisations
are used in this report. (1) In the United Nations system, there is no
established convention for designating of developed and developing
countries or areas. (2) The United Nations Statistics Division specifies
developed and developing regions based on common practice.
In addition, specific countries are designated as Least Developed
Countries (LDC), landlocked developing countries, small island
developing states (SIDS), and transition economies. Many countries
appear in more than one of these categories. (3) The World Bank
uses income as the main criterion for classifying countries as
low, lower middle, upper middle, and high income. (4) The United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) aggregates indicators for
life expectancy, educational attainment, and income into a single
composite Human Development Index (HDI) to classify countries as
low, medium, high, or very high human development.
Inequality See Equality.
Institution Rules, norms and conventions held in common by
social actors that guide, constrain and shape human interaction.
Institutions can be formal, such as laws and policies, or informal,
such as norms and conventions. Organisations - such as parliaments,
regulatory agencies, private firms, and community bodies - develop
and act in response to institutional frameworks and the incentives
they frame. Institutions can guide, constrain and shape human
interaction through direct control, through incentives, and through
processes of socialisation. See also Institutional capacity.
Institutional capacity Building and strengthening individual
organisations and providing technical and management training to
support integrated planning and decision-making processes between
organisations and people, as well as empowerment, social capital,
and an enabling environment, including the culture, values and
power relations (Willems and Baumert, 2003).
Integrated assessment A method of analysis that combines
results and models from the physical, biological, economic and
social sciences and the interactions among these components in
a consistent framework to evaluate the status and the consequences
of environmental change and the policy responses to it. See also
Integrated assessment model (IAM).
Integrated assessment model (IAM) Models that integrate
knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. They
are one of the main tools for undertaking integrated assessments.
One class of IAM used in respect of climate change mitigation may
include representations of: multiple sectors of the economy, such as
energy, land use and land use change; interactions between sectors;
the economy as a whole; associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
and sinks; and reduced representations of the climate system. This
class of model is used to assess linkages between economic, social
and technological development and the evolution of the climate
system. Another class of IAM additionally includes representations of
the costs associated with climate change impacts, but includes less
detailed representations of economic systems. These can be used to
assess impacts and mitigation in a cost-benefit framework and have
been used to estimate the social cost of carbon.
Integrated response options In this report, integrated
response options are those options that simultaneously address
more than one land challenge. These can be categorised into options
that rely on a) land management, b) value chain management, and
c) risk management. Integrated response options are not mutually
exclusive. See also Land challenge.
Integrated water resources management (IWRM) A process
which promotes the coordinated development and management of
water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and
social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the
sustainability of vital ecosystems.
Inter-generational equity See Equity.
Internal variability See Climate variability.
Irreversibility A perturbed state of a dynamical system is defined
as irreversible on a given timescale if the recovery timescale from
this state due to natural processes is substantially longer than the
time it takes for the system to reach this perturbed state. See also
Tipping point.
Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an
international treaty adopted in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, at
the Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP3) to the
UNFCCC. It contains legally binding commitments, in addition to
those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the
Protocol (mostly OECD countries and countries with economies in
transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs),
and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) by at least 5% below 1990 levels
in the first commitment period (2008–2012). The Kyoto Protocol
entered into force on 16 February 2005 and as of May 2018 had 192
Parties (191 States and the European Union). A second commitment
period was agreed in December 2012 at COP18, known as the Doha
Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which a new set of Parties
committed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 18% below 1990
levels in the period from 2013 to 2020. However, as of May 2018, the
Doha Amendment had not received sufficient ratifications to enter
into force. See also Paris Agreement.
Land The terrestrial portion of the biosphere that comprises the
natural resources (soil, near surface air, vegetation and other biota,
and water), the ecological processes, topography, and human
settlements and infrastructure that operate within that system (FAO,
; UNCCD, 1994).
Land challenges In this report, land challenges refers to landbased
mitigation and adaptation, desertification, land degradation
and food security.
Land cover The biophysical coverage of land (e.g., bare soil,
rocks, forests, buildings and roads or lakes). Land cover is often
categorised in broad land-cover classes (e.g., deciduous forest,
coniferous forest, mixed forest, grassland, bare ground). [Note: In
some literature assessed in this report, land cover and land use are
used interchangeably, but the two represent distinct classification
systems. For example, the land cover class woodland can be under
various land uses such as livestock grazing, recreation, conservation,
or wood harvest.] See also Land cover change, and Land-use change.

Glossary Annex I
AI
Land cover change Change from one land cover class to another,
due to change in land use or change in natural conditions (Pongratz et
al., 2018). See also Land-use change, and Land management change.
Land degradation A negative trend in land condition, caused by
direct or indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic
climate change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least
one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or
value to humans. [Note: This definition applies to forest and nonforest
land. Changes in land condition resulting solely from natural
processes (such as volcanic eruptions) are not considered to be
land degradation. Reduction of biological productivity or ecological
integrity or value to humans can constitute degradation, but any one
of these changes need not necessarily be considered degradation.]
Land degradation neutrality A state whereby the amount
and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem
functions and services and enhance food security remain stable or
increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems
(UNCCD, 2019).
Land management Sum of land-use practices (e.g., sowing,
fertilizing, weeding, harvesting, thinning, clear-cutting) that take
place within broader land-use categories. (Pongratz et al., 2018)
Land management change
A change in land management that occurs within a land-use category.
See also Land-use change.
Land potential The inherent, long-term potential of the land to
sustainably generate ecosystem services, which reflects the capacity
and resilience of the land-based natural capital, in the face of ongoing
environmental change (UNEP, 2016).
Land rehabilitation Direct or indirect actions undertaken with
the aim of reinstating a level of ecosystem functionality, where
the goal is provision of goods and services rather than ecological
restoration (McDonald, et al., 2016).
Land restoration The process of assisting the recovery of land
from a degraded state (McDonald et al., 2016; IPBES, 2018).
Land surface air temperature (LSAT) The near-surface air
temperature over land, typically measured at 1.25–2 m above the
ground using standard meteorological equipment.
Land use The total of arrangements, activities and inputs applied
to a parcel of land. The term land use is also used in the sense of
the social and economic purposes for which land is managed
(e.g., grazing, timber extraction, conservation and city dwelling).
In national GHG inventories, land use is classified according to
the IPCC land use categories of forest land, cropland, grassland,
wetlands, settlements, other lands (see the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for
National GHG Inventories for details). See also Land-use change and
Land management.
Land-use change (LUC) The change from one land use category
to another. [Note: In some of the scientific literature assessed in this
report, land-use change encompasses changes in land-use categories
as well as changes in land management.]
Indirect land-use change (iLUC)
Land use change outside the area of focus, that occurs as
a consequence of change in use or management of land within the
area of focus, such as through market or policy drivers. For example,
if agricultural land is diverted to biofuel production, forest clearance
may occur elsewhere to replace the former agricultural production.
See also Afforestation, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU), Deforestation, Land use, land-use change and forestry
(LULUCF), Reforestation, the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-
Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000), and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines
for National GHG Inventories (IPCC, 2006).
Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) In the
context of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC,
), LULUCF is a GHG inventory sector that covers anthropogenic
emissions and removals of GHG in managed lands, excluding non-
CO2 agricultural emissions. Following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines
for National GHG Inventories, ‘anthropogenic’ land-related GHG
fluxes are defined as all those occurring on ‘managed land’, i.e.,
‘where human interventions and practices have been applied to
perform production, ecological or social functions’. Since managed
land may include carbon dioxide (CO2) removals not considered
as ‘anthropogenic’ in some of the scientific literature assessed in
this report (e.g., removals associated with CO2 fertilisation and
N deposition), the land-related net GHG emission estimates from
global models included in this report are not necessarily directly
comparable with LULUCF estimates in National GHG Inventories. See
also Land-use change (LUC).
Latent heat flux The turbulent flux of heat from the Earth’s
surface to the atmosphere that is associated with evaporation or
condensation of water vapour at the surface; a component of the
surface energy budget. See also Atmosphere, and Flux.
Leakage The effects of policies that result in a displacement of the
environmental impact, thereby counteracting the intended effects of
the initial policies.
Lifecycle assessment (LCA) Compilation and evaluation of the
inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product
or service throughout its life cycle (ISO, 2018).
Likelihood The chance of a specific outcome occurring, where this
might be estimated probabilistically. Likelihood is expressed in this
report using a standard terminology (Mastrandrea et al., 2010). See
also Agreement, Evidence, Confidence, and Uncertainty.
Livelihood The resources used and the activities undertaken in
order to live. Livelihoods are usually determined by the entitlements
and assets to which people have access. Such assets can be
categorised as human, social, natural, physical, or financial.
Local knowledge The understandings and skills developed
by individuals and populations, specific to the places where they
live. Local knowledge informs decision-making about fundamental
aspects of life, from day-to-day activities to longer term actions.
This knowledge is a key element of the social and cultural systems
which influence observations of, and responses to climate change;
it also informs governance decisions (UNESCO, 2018). See also
Indigenous knowledge.


Lock-in A situation in which the future development of a system,
including infrastructure, technologies, investments, institutions, and
behavioural norms, is determined or constrained (‘locked in’) by
historic developments.
Long-lived climate forcers (LLCF) A set of well-mixed
greenhouse gases with long atmospheric lifetimes. This set of
compounds includes carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O),
together with some fluorinated gases. They have a warming effect on
climate. These compounds accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal
to centennial timescales, and their effect on climate hence persists
for decades to centuries after their emission. On timescales of
decades to a century already emitted emissions of long-lived climate
forcers can only be abated by greenhouse gas removal (GGR). See
also Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF).
Loss and Damage, and losses and damages Research has
taken Loss and Damage (capitalised letters) to refer to political
debate under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) following the establishment of the Warsaw
Mechanism on Loss and Damage in 2013, which is to ‘address loss
and damage associated with impacts of climate change, including
extreme events and slow onset events, in developing countries that
are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.’
Lowercase letters (losses and damages) have been taken to refer
broadly to harm from (observed) impacts and (projected) risks
(Mechler et al., 2018).
Maladaptive actions (Maladaptation) Actions that may lead
to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via
increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increased vulnerability
to climate change, or diminished welfare, now or in the future.
Maladaptation is usually an unintended consequence.
Malnutrition Deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s
intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition addresses
three broad groups of conditions: undernutrition, which includes
wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age)
and underweight (low weight-for-age); micronutrient-related
malnutrition, which includes micronutrient deficiencies (a lack of
important vitamins and minerals) or micronutrient excess; and
overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases
(such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers) (WHO,
). Micronutrient deficiencies are sometimes termed ‘hidden
hunger’ to emphasise that people can be malnourished in the sense
of deficient without being deficient in calories. Hidden hunger can
apply even where people are obese.
Managed forest Forests subject to human interventions (notably
silvicultural management such as planting, pruning, thinning), timber
and fuelwood harvest, protection (fire suppression, insect supression)
and management for amenity values or conservation, with defined
geographical boundaries (Ogle et al., 2018). [Note: For a discussion
of the term ‘forest’ in the context of National GHG inventories, see
the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories.] See also
Managed land.
Managed grassland Grasslands on which human interventions
are carried out, such as grazing domestic livestock or hay removal.
Managed land In the context of national greenhouse gas (GHG)
inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
GHG Inventories (IPCC, 2006) defines managed land ‘where human
interventions and practices have been applied to perform production,
ecological or social functions’. The IPCC (2006) defines anthropogenic
GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector as all those
occurring on ‘managed land’. The key rationale for this approach is
that the preponderance of anthropogenic effects occurs on managed
lands. [Note: More details can be found in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for
National GHG Inventories, Volume 4, Chapter 1.]
Market failure When private decisions are based on market
prices that do not reflect the real scarcity of goods and services but
rather reflect market distortions, they do not generate an efficient
allocation of resources but cause welfare losses. A market distortion
is any event in which a market reaches a market clearing price
that is substantially different from the price that a market would
achieve while operating under conditions of perfect competition and
state enforcement of legal contracts and the ownership of private
property. Examples of factors causing market prices to deviate from
real economic scarcity are environmental externalities, public goods,
monopoly power, information asymmetry, transaction costs, and nonrational
behaviour.
Measurement, reporting and verification (MRV)
Measurement
‘The process of data collection over time, providing basic datasets,
including associated accuracy and precision, for the range of
relevant variables. Possible data sources are field measurements,
field observations, detection through remote sensing and interviews’
(UN REDD, 2009).
Reporting
‘The process of formal reporting of assessment results to the UNFCCC,
according to predetermined formats and according to established
standards, especially the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) Guidelines and GPG (Good Practice Guidance)’ (UN REDD,
).
Verification
‘The process of formal verification of reports, for example, the
established approach to verify national communications and national
inventory reports to the UNFCCC’ (UN REDD, 2009).
Megadrought See Drought.
Methane (CH4) One of the six greenhouse gases (GHGs) to be
mitigated under the Kyoto Protocol. Methane is the major component
of natural gas and associated with all hydrocarbon fuels. Significant
anthropogenic emissions also occur as a result of animal husbandry
and paddy rice production. Methane is also produced naturally
where organic matter decays under anaerobic conditions, such as
in wetlands.
Migrant See Migration.
Migration ‘The movement of a person or a group of persons, either
across an international border, or within a State. It is a population
movement, encompassing any kind of movement of people, whatever
its length, composition and causes; it includes migration of refugees,

Glossary Annex I
AI
displaced persons, economic migrants, and persons moving for other
purposes, including family reunification’ (IOM, 2018).
Migrant
‘Any person who is moving or has moved across an international
border or within a State away from his/her habitual place of residence,
regardless of (1) the person’s legal status; (2) whether the movement
is voluntary or involuntary; (3) what the causes for the movement are;
or (4) what the length of the stay is’ (IOM, 2018).

Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) A set of eight
time-bound and measurable goals for combating poverty, hunger,
disease, illiteracy, discrimination against women and environmental
degradation. These goals were agreed at the UN Millennium Summit
in 2000 together with an action plan to reach the goals by 2015.
Mitigation (of climate change) A human intervention to
reduce emissions or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.
Mitigation behaviour See Human behaviour.
Mitigation measures In climate policy, mitigation measures are
technologies, processes or practices that contribute to mitigation,
for example renewable energy technologies, waste minimisation
processes, public transport commuting practices.
Mitigation option A technology or practice that reduces
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or enhances sinks.
Mitigation pathways See Pathways.
Mitigation scenario A plausible description of the future that
describes how the (studied) system responds to the implementation
of mitigation policies and measures. See also Emission scenario,
Pathways, Socio-economic scenarios, and Stabilisation (of GHG or
CO2-equivalent concentration).
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) Mechanisms put in place
at national to local scales to respectively monitor and evaluate
efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or adapt to the
impacts of climate change with the aim of systematically identifying,
characterising and assessing progress over time.
Motivation (of an individual) An individual’s reason or
reasons for acting in a particular way; individuals may consider
various consequences of actions, including financial, social, affective,
and environmental consequences. Motivation can arise from factors
external or internal to the individual.
Multi-level governance See Governance.
Narratives (in the context of scenarios) Qualitative
descriptions of plausible future world evolutions, describing
the characteristics, general logic and developments underlying
a particular quantitative set of scenarios. Narratives are also referred
to in the literature as ‘storylines’. See also Scenario, Scenario storyline,
and Pathways.
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) A term used
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) whereby a country that has joined the Paris Agreement
outlines its plans for reducing its emissions. Some countries NDCs
also address how they will adapt to climate change impacts, and
what support they need from, or will provide to, other countries to
adopt low-carbon pathways and to build climate resilience. According
to Article 4 paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement, each Party shall
prepare, communicate and maintain successive NDCs that it intends
to achieve. In the lead up to the 21st Conference of the Parties in
Paris in 2015, countries submitted Intended Nationally Determined
Contributions (INDCs). As countries join the Paris Agreement, unless
they decide otherwise, this INDC becomes their first Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC).
Negative emissions Removal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from
the atmosphere by deliberate human activities, i.e., in addition to the
removal that would occur via natural carbon cycle processes. See
also Net negative emissions, Net-zero emissions, Carbon dioxide
removal (CDR), and Greenhouse gas removal (GGR).
Negative emissions technologies An activity or mechanism
that results in negative emissions.
Net negative emissions A situation of net negative emissions is
achieved when, as result of human activities, more greenhouse gases
(GHG) are removed from the atmosphere than are emitted into it.
Where multiple greenhouse gases are involved, the quantification of
negative emissions depends on the climate metric chosen to compare
emissions of different gases (such as global warming potential, global
temperature change potential, and others, as well as the chosen time
horizon). See also Negative emissions, Net-zero emissions and Netzero
CO2 emissions.
Net-zero CO2 emissions Conditions in which any remaining
anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are balanced by
anthropogenic CO2 removals over a specified period. See also Netzero
emissions, and Net negative emissions.
Net-zero emissions Net-zero emissions are achieved when
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere are
balanced by anthropogenic removals. Where multiple greenhouse
gases are involved, the quantification of net-zero emissions depends
on the climate metric chosen to compare emissions of different
gases (such as global warming potential, global temperature
change potential, and others, as well as the chosen time horizon).
See also Net-zero CO2 emissions, Negative emissions, and Net
negative emissions.
Nitrous oxide (N2O) One of the six greenhouse gases (GHGs)
to be mitigated under the Kyoto Protocol. The main anthropogenic
source of N2O is agriculture (soil and animal manure management),
but important contributions also come from sewage treatment,
fossil fuel combustion, and chemical industrial processes. N2O is also
produced naturally from a wide variety of biological sources in soil
and water, particularly microbial action in wet tropical forests.
Non-overshoot pathways See Pathways.
Nutrition transition A predictable change in dietary patterns
associated with a country’s economic development whereby
‘problems of under- and overnutrition often coexist, reflecting the
trends in which an increasing proportion of people consume the types
of diets associated with a number of chronic diseases’ (Popkin, 1994).


Ocean acidification (OA) A reduction in the pH of the ocean,
accompanied by other chemical changes, over an extended period,
typically decades or longer, which is caused primarily by uptake
of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, but can also be
caused by other chemical additions or subtractions from the ocean.
Anthropogenic ocean acidification refers to the component of pH
reduction that is caused by human activity (IPCC, 2011, p. 37). See
also Climate change.
Ocean fertilisation Deliberate increase of nutrient supply to
the near-surface ocean in order to enhance biological production
through which additional carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere
is sequestered. This can be achieved by the addition of micronutrients
or macro-nutrients. Ocean fertilisation is regulated by the
London Protocol
Overshoot See Temperature overshoot.
Overshoot pathways See Pathways.
Ozone (O3) The triatomic form of oxygen (O3). In the troposphere,
it is created both naturally and by photochemical reactions involving
gases resulting from human activities (smog). Tropospheric ozone acts
as a greenhouse gas (GHG). In the stratosphere, it is created by the
interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecular oxygen
(O2). Stratospheric ozone plays a dominant role in the stratospheric
radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in the ozone layer.
Paris Agreement The Paris Agreement under the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted on
December 2015 in Paris, France, at the 21st session of the Conference
of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. The agreement, adopted by 196
Parties to the UNFCCC, entered into force on 4 November 2016 and
as of May 2018 had 195 Signatories and was ratified by 177 Parties.
One of the goals of the Paris Agreement is ‘Holding the increase in the
global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial
levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C
above pre-industrial levels’, recognising that this would significantly
reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Additionally, the
Agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with
the impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement is intended
to become fully effective in 2020. See also Kyoto Protocol, and
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
Participatory governance See Governance.
Pasture Area covered with grass or other plants used or suitable
for grazing of livestock; grassland.
Pathways The temporal evolution of natural and/or human
systems towards a future state. Pathway concepts range from sets
of quantitative and qualitative scenarios or narratives of potential
futures to solution-oriented decision-making processes to achieve
desirable societal goals. Pathway approaches typically focus on
biophysical, techno-economic, and/or socio-behavioural trajectories
and involve various dynamics, goals, and actors across different scales.
.5°C pathway
A pathway of emissions of greenhouse gases and other climate
forcers that provides an approximately one-in-two to two-in-three
chance, given current knowledge of the climate response, of global
warming either remaining below 1.5°C or returning to 1.5°C by
around 2100 following an overshoot.
See also Temperature overshoot.
Adaptation pathways
A series of adaptation choices involving trade-offs between shortterm
and long-term goals and values. These are processes of
deliberation to identify solutions that are meaningful to people in
the context of their daily lives and to avoid potential maladaptation.
Development pathways
Development pathways are trajectories based on an array of social,
economic, cultural, technological, institutional, and biophysical
features that characterise the interactions between human and
natural systems and outline visions for the future, at a particular scale.
Mitigation pathways
A mitigation pathway is a temporal evolution of a set of mitigation
scenario features, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and
socio-economic development.
Overshoot pathways
Pathways that exceed the stabilisation level (concentration, forcing,
or temperature) before the end of a time horizon of interest
(e.g., before 2100) and then decline towards that level by that time.
Once the target level is exceeded, removal by sinks of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) is required. See also Temperature overshoot.
Non-overshoot pathways
Pathways that stay below the stabilisation level (concentration,
forcing, or temperature) during the time horizon of interest (e.g.,
until 2100).
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)
Scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations
of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and
chemically active gases, as well as land use/land cover (Moss et
al., 2008). The word representative signifies that each RCP provides
only one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific
radiative forcing characteristics. The term pathway emphasises the
fact that not only the long-term concentration levels, but also the
trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome are of interest
(Moss et al., 2010). RCPs were used to develop climate projections in
CMIP5. See also Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), and
Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).
• RCP2.6: One pathway where radiative forcing peaks at
approximately 3 W m–2 and then declines to be limited at
.6 W m–2 in 2100 (the corresponding Extended Concentration
Pathway, or ECP, has constant emissions after 2100).
• RCP4.5 and RCP6.0: Two intermediate stabilisation pathways in
which radiative forcing is limited at approximately 4.5 W m–2
and 6.0 W m–2 in 2100 (the corresponding ECPs have constant
concentrations after 2150).
• RCP8.5: One high pathway which leads to >8.5 W m–2 in 2100
(the corresponding ECP has constant emissions after 2100 until
and constant concentrations after 2250).
Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)
Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) were developed to
complement the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) with
varying socio-economic challenges to adaptation and mitigation

Glossary Annex I
AI
(O’Neill et al., 2014). Based on five narratives, the SSPs describe
alternative socio-economic futures in the absence of climate policy
intervention, comprising sustainable development (SSP1), regional
rivalry (SSP3), inequality (SSP4), fossil–fueled development (SSP5),
and a middle-of-the-road development (SSP2) (O’Neill et al., 2017;
Riahi et al., 2017). The combination of SSP-based socio-economic
scenarios and RCP-based climate projections provides an integrative
frame for climate impact and policy analysis.
Transformation pathways
Trajectories describing consistent sets of possible futures of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, atmospheric concentrations,
or global mean surface temperatures implied from mitigation and
adaptation actions associated with a set of broad and irreversible
economic, technological, societal, and behavioural changes. This can
encompass changes in the way energy and infrastructure are used
and produced, natural resources are managed and institutions are set
up and in the pace and direction of technological change (TC).
See also Scenario, Scenario storyline, Emission scenario, Mitigation
scenario, Baseline scenario, Stabilisation (of GHG or CO2-equivalent
concentration), and Narratives.
Peat Soft, porous or compressed, sedentary deposit of which
a substantial portion is partly decomposed plant material with high
water content in the natural state (up to about 90 percent) (IPCC,
). See also Peatlands.
Peatlands Peatland is a land where soils are dominated by peat.
See also Reservoir, and Sink.
Peri-urban areas Parts of a city that appear to be quite rural
but are in reality strongly linked functionally to the city in its daily
activities.
Permafrost Ground (soil or rock and included ice and
organic material) that remains at or below 0°C for at least two
consecutive years.
pH A dimensionless measure of the acidity of a solution given
by its concentration of hydrogen ions ([H+]). pH is measured on
a logarithmic scale where pH = -log10[H+]. Thus, a pH decrease of
unit corresponds to a 10-fold increase in the concentration of H+, or
acidity. See also Ocean acidification.
Phenology The relationship between biological phenomena that
recur periodically (e.g., development stages, migration) and climate
and seasonal changes.
Planetary health The Rockefeller-Lancet Commission defines
planetary health as ‘the achievement of the highest attainable
standard of health, well-being, and equity worldwide through
judicious attention to the human systems — political, economic, and
social — that shape the future of humanity and the Earth’s natural
systems that define the safe environmental limits within which
humanity can flourish. Put simply, planetary health is the health of
human civilisation and the state of the natural systems on which it
depends’ (Whitmee et al., 2015).
Political economy The set of interlinked relationships between
people, the state, society and markets as defined by law, politics,
economics, customs and power that determine the outcome of
trade and transactions and the distribution of wealth in a country
or economy.
Pool, carbon and nitrogen A reservoir in the earth system where
elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, reside in various chemical
forms for a period of time.
Poverty A complex concept with several definitions stemming
from different schools of thought. It can refer to material
circumstances (such as need, pattern of deprivation or limited
resources), economic conditions (such as standard of living, inequality
or economic position) and/or social relationships (such as social class,
dependency, exclusion, lack of basic security or lack of entitlement).
See also Poverty eradication.
Poverty eradication A set of measures to end poverty in all its
forms everywhere. See also Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Precursors Atmospheric compounds that are not greenhouse
gases (GHGs) or aerosols, but that have an effect on GHG or aerosol
concentrations by taking part in physical or chemical processes
regulating their production or destruction rates. See also Aerosol, and
Greenhouse gas (GHG).
Pre-industrial The multi-century period prior to the onset of
large-scale industrial activity around 1750. The reference period
–1900 is used to approximate pre-industrial global mean
surface temperature (GMST). See also Industrial revolution.
Primary production The synthesis of organic compounds
by plants and microbes, on land or in the ocean, primarily by
photosynthesis using light and carbon dioxide (CO2) as sources
of energy and carbon respectively. It can also occur through
chemosynthesis, using chemical energy, e.g., in deep sea vents.
Gross Primary Production (GPP)
The total amount of carbon fixed by photosynthesis over a specific
time period.
Net primary production (NPP)
The amount of carbon accumulated through photosynthesis minus
the amount lost by plant respiration over a specified time period that
would prevail in the absence of land use.
Procedural equity See Equity
Procedural rights See Human rights.
Projection A potential future evolution of a quantity or set of
quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Unlike predictions,
projections are conditional on assumptions concerning, for example,
future socio-economic and technological developments that may
or may not be realised. See also Climate projection, Scenario,
and Pathways.
Radiative forcing The change in the net, downward minus
upward, radiative flux (expressed in W m–2) at the tropopause or
top of atmosphere due to a change in a driver of climate change,
such as a change in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2),
the concentration of volcanic aerosols or the output of the Sun.
The traditional radiative forcing is computed with all tropospheric
properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after allowing
for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiativedynamical
equilibrium. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no


change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for. The radiative
forcing once rapid adjustments are accounted for is termed the
effective radiative forcing. Radiative forcing is not to be confused with
cloud radiative forcing, which describes an unrelated measure of the
impact of clouds on the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere.
Reasons for concern (RFCs) Elements of a classification
framework, first developed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report,
which aims to facilitate judgments about what level of climate
change may be dangerous (in the language of Article 2 of the
UNFCCC) by aggregating risks from various sectors, considering
hazards, exposures, vulnerabilities, capacities to adapt, and the
resulting impacts.
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation (REDD+) REDD+ refers to reducing emissions
from deforestation; reducing emissions from forest degradation;
conservation of forest carbon stocks; sustainable management
of forests; and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (see UNFCCC
decision 1/CP.16, para. 70).
Reference period The period relative to which anomalies are
computed. See also Anomalies.
Reference scenario See Baseline scenario.
Reforestation Conversion to forest of land that has previously
contained forests but that has been converted to some other use.
[Note: For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such
as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation in the context
of reporting and accounting Article 3.3 and 3.4 activities under
the Kyoto Protocol, see 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods
and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol.] See
also Afforestation, Deforestation, and Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
Region A relatively large-scale land or ocean area characterised
by specific geographical and climatological features. The climate of
a land-based region is affected by regional and local scale features
like topography, land use characteristics and large water bodies, as
well as remote influences from other regions, in addition to global
climate conditions. The IPCC defines a set of standard regions for
analyses of observed climate trends and climate model projections
(see IPCC 2018, Fig. 3.2; AR5, SREX).
Remaining carbon budget Cumulative global carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions from the start of 2018 to the time that CO2 emissions
reach net-zero that would result, at some probability, in limiting
global warming to a given level, accounting for the impact of other
anthropogenic emissions. See also Carbon budget.
Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) See
Pathways.
Reservoir A component or components of the climate system
where a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is
stored (UNFCCC Article 1.7).
Resilience The capacity of interconnected social, economic
and ecological systems to cope with a hazardous event, trend or
disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their
essential function, identity and structure. Resilience is a positive
attribute when it maintains capacity for adaptation, learning and/
or transformation (adapted from the Arctic Council, 2013). See also
Hazard, Risk, and Vulnerability.
Respiration The process whereby living organisms convert
organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2), releasing energy and
consuming molecular oxygen.
Rewetting ‘The deliberate action of changing a drained soil
into a wet soil, e.g. by blocking drainage ditches, disabling pumping
facilities or breaching obstructions’ (IPCC, 2013). See also Drainage.
Risk The potential for adverse consequences for human or
ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives
associated with such systems. In the context of climate change,
risks can arise from potential impacts of climate change as well as
human responses to climate change. Relevant adverse consequences
include those on lives, livelihoods, health and well-being, economic,
social and cultural assets and investments, infrastructure, services
(including ecosystem services), ecosystems and species.
In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic
interactions between climate-related hazards with the exposure
and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system to the
hazards. Hazards, exposure and vulnerability may each be subject
to uncertainty in terms of magnitude and likelihood of occurrence,
and each may change over time and space due to socio-economic
changes and human decision-making (see also risk management,
adaptation, and mitigation).
In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the
potential for such responses not achieving the intended objective(s),
or from potential trade-offs with, or negative side-effects on, other
societal objectives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (see
also risk trade-off). Risks can arise for example from uncertainty in
implementation, effectiveness or outcomes of climate policy, climaterelated
investments, technology development or adoption, and
system transitions.
Risk assessment The qualitative and/or quantitative scientific
estimation of risks. See also Risk management, and Risk perception.
Risk management Plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce
the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences,
based on assessed or perceived risks. See also Risk assessment, and
Risk perception.
Risk perception The subjective judgment that people make about
the characteristics and severity of a risk. See also Risk assessment,
and Risk management.
Risk trade-off The change in portfolio of risks that occurs when
a countervailing risk is generated (knowingly or inadvertently) by an
intervention to reduce the target risk (Wiener and Graham, 2009).
See also Adverse side-effect, and Co-benefits.
Runoff The flow of water over the surface or through the
subsurface, which typically originates from the part of liquid
precipitation and/or snow/ice melt that does not evaporate or
refreeze, and is not transpired. See also Hydrological cycle.
Saline soils Soils with levels of soluble salts (commonly sulphates
and chlorides of calcium and magnesium) in the saturation extract

Glossary Annex I
AI
high enough to negatively affect plant growth. Saline soils are usually
flocculated and have good water permeability (Well and Brady, 2016).
See also Soil salinity and Sodic soils.
Scenario A plausible description of how the future may develop
based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions
about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change (TC),
prices) and relationships. Note that scenarios are neither predictions
nor forecasts, but are used to provide a view of the implications
of developments and actions. See also Baseline scenario, Emission
scenario, Mitigation scenario and Pathways.
Scenario storyline A narrative description of a scenario (or
family of scenarios), highlighting the main scenario characteristics,
relationships between key driving forces and the dynamics of their
evolution. Also referred to as ‘narratives’ in the scenario literature.
Sea ice Ice found at the sea surface that has originated from
the freezing of seawater. Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice
floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice),
or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). Sea ice
concentration is the fraction of the ocean covered by ice. Sea ice less
than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that
survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year
ice and multi-year ice, where multi-year ice has survived at least
two summers.
Sea level change (sea level rise/sea level fall) Change to
the height of sea level, both globally and locally (relative sea level
change) due to (1) a change in ocean volume as a result of a change
in the mass of water in the ocean, (2) changes in ocean volume
as a result of changes in ocean water density, (3) changes in the
shape of the ocean basins and changes in the Earth’s gravitational
and rotational fields, and (4) local subsidence or uplift of the land.
Global mean sea level change resulting from change in the mass
of the ocean is called barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level
change due to the addition or removal of a mass of water is called
its sea level equivalent (SLE). Sea level changes, both globally and
locally, resulting from changes in water density are called steric.
Density changes induced by temperature changes only are called
thermosteric, while density changes induced by salinity changes
are called halosteric. Barystatic and steric sea level changes do not
include the effect of changes in the shape of ocean basins induced by
the change in the ocean mass and its distribution.
Sea surface temperature (SST) The subsurface bulk
temperature in the top few meters of the ocean, measured by ships,
buoys, and drifters. From ships, measurements of water samples in
buckets were mostly switched in the 1940s to samples from engine
intake water. Satellite measurements of skin temperature (uppermost
layer; a fraction of a millimetre thick) in the infrared or the top
centimetre or so in the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted
to be compatible with the bulk temperature.
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction The Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 outlines seven
clear targets and four priorities for action to prevent new, and to
reduce existing disaster risks. The voluntary, non-binding agreement
recognises that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk
but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders
including local government, the private sector and other stakeholders,
with the aim for the substantial reduction of disaster risk and
losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical,
social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses,
communities and countries.

Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) A set of compounds that are
primarily composed of those with short lifetimes in the atmosphere
compared to well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs), and are also
referred to as near-term climate forcers. This set of compounds
includes methane (CH4), which is also a well-mixed greenhouse gas,
as well as ozone (O3) and aerosols, or their precursors, and some
halogenated species that are not well-mixed greenhouse gases.
These compounds do not accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to
centennial timescales, and so their effect on climate is predominantly
in the first decade after their emission, although their changes can still
induce long-term climate effects such as sea level change. Their effect
can be cooling or warming. A subset of exclusively warming shortlived
climate forcers is referred to as short-lived climate pollutants.
See also Long-lived climate forcers (LLCF).
Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) See Short-lived climate
forcers (SLCF).
Sink Any process, activity or mechanism which removes
a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas
from the atmosphere (UNFCCC Article 1.8). See also Sequestration,
Source, and Uptake.
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Small Island

Developing States), are a distinct group of developing countries
facing specific social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities
(UN-OHRLLS, 2011). They were recognised as a special case both for
their environment and development at the Rio Earth Summit in Brazil
in 1992. Fifty eight countries and territories are presently classified

Social-ecological system An integrated system that includes
human societies and ecosystems, in which humans are part of
nature. The functions of such a system arise from the interactions and

the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs (WCED, 1987) and
balances social, economic and environmental concerns. See also
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and Development pathways
(under Pathways).
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The 17 global goals
for development for all countries established by the United Nations
through a participatory process and elaborated in the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development, including ending poverty and hunger;
ensuring health and well-being, education, gender equality, clean

See also Sustainable development (SD).
Sustainable forest management The stewardship and use of
forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their
biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their
potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic
and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that
does not cause damage to other ecosystems (Forest Europe, 1993).
Sustainable intensification (of agriculture) Increasing yields
from the same area of land while decreasing negative environmental
impacts of agricultural production and increasing the provision of
environmental services (CGIAR, 2019). [Note: this definition is based
on the concept of meeting demand from a finite land area, but it
is scale-dependent. Sustainable intensification at a given scale (e.g.,
global or national) may require a decrease in production intensity
at smaller scales and in particular places (often associated with
previous, unsustainable, intensification) to achieve sustainability
(Garnett et al., 2013).]

Glossary Annex I

Sustainable land management The stewardship and use of
land resources, including soils, water, animals and plants, to meet
changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term
productive potential of these resources and the maintenance of their
environmental functions (Adapted from WOCAT, undated).
Technology transfer The exchange of knowledge, hardware and
associated software, money and goods among stakeholders, which
leads to the spread of technology for adaptation or mitigation. The
term encompasses both diffusion of technologies and technological
cooperation across and within countries.
Teleconnections A statistical association between climate
variables at widely separated, geographically-fixed spatial locations.
Teleconnections are caused by large spatial structures such as basinwide
coupled modes of ocean-atmosphere variability, Rossby wavetrains,
mid-latitude jets and storm tracks, etc.
Temperature overshoot The temporary exceedance of a
specified level of global warming, such as 1.5°C. Overshoot implies
a peak followed by a decline in global warming, achieved through
anthropogenic removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) exceeding remaining
CO2 emissions globally. See also Pathways (Subterms: Overshoot
pathways, Non-overshoot Pathways).
Tier In the context of the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
Gas Inventories, a tier represents a level of methodological complexity.
Usually three tiers are provided. Tier 1 is the basic method, Tier 2
intermediate and Tier 3 most demanding in terms of complexity
and data requirements. Tiers 2 and 3 are sometimes referred to as
higher tier methods and are generally considered to be more accurate
(IPCC, 2019).
Tipping point A level of change in system properties beyond
which a system reorganises, often abruptly, and does not return to
the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated. For the
climate system, it refers to a critical threshold beyond which global
or regional climate changes from one stable state to another stable
state. Tipping points are also used when referring to impact: the term
can imply that an impact tipping point is (about to be) reached in
a natural or human system. See also Irreversibility.
Transformation A change in the fundamental attributes of
natural and human systems.
Societal (social) transformation
A profound and often deliberate shift initiated by communities toward
sustainability, facilitated by changes in individual and collective
values and behaviours, and a fairer balance of political, cultural, and
institutional power in society.
Transformation pathways See Pathways.
Transformational adaptation See Adaptation.
Transformative change A system wide change that alters the
fundamental attributes of the system.
Transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions
(TCRE) The transient global average surface temperature change
per unit cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, usually 1000
GtC. TCRE combines both information on the airborne fraction of
cumulative CO2 emissions (the fraction of the total CO2 emitted that
remains in the atmosphere, which is determined by carbon cycle
processes) and on the transient climate response (TCR). See also
Transient climate response (TCR) (under Climate sensitivity).
Transit-oriented development (TOD) An approach to urban
development that maximises the amount of residential, business and
leisure space within walking distance of efficient public transport, so
as to enhance mobility of citizens, the viability of public transport and
the value of urban land in mutually supporting ways.
Transition The process of changing from one state or condition to
another in a given period of time. Transition can occur in individuals,
firms, cities, regions and nations, and can be based on incremental or
transformative change.
Tropical cyclone The general term for a strong, cyclonic-scale
disturbance that originates over tropical oceans. Distinguished from
weaker systems (often named tropical disturbances or depressions)
by exceeding a threshold wind speed. A tropical storm is a tropical
cyclone with one-minute average surface winds between 18 and
m s–1. Beyond 32 m s–1, a tropical cyclone is called a hurricane,
typhoon, or cyclone, depending on geographic location. See also
Extratropical cyclone.
Troposphere The lowest part of the atmosphere, from the surface
to about 10 km in altitude at mid-latitudes (ranging from 9 km at
high latitudes to 16 km in the tropics on average), where clouds and
weather phenomena occur. In the troposphere, temperatures generally
decrease with height. See also Atmosphere, and Stratosphere.
Uncertainty A state of incomplete knowledge that can result
from a lack of information or from disagreement about what is
known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources,
from imprecision in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or
terminology, incomplete understanding of critical processes, or
uncertain projections of human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore
be represented by quantitative measures (e.g., a probability density
function) or by qualitative statements (e.g., reflecting the judgment
of a team of experts) (see IPCC, 2004; Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Moss
and Schneider, 2000). See also Confidence, and Likelihood.
United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD) A legally binding international agreement linking
environment and development to sustainable land management,
established in 1994. The Convention’s objective is ‘to combat
desertification and mitigate the effects of drought in countries
experiencing drought and/or desertification’. The Convention
specifically addresses the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas,
known as the drylands, and has a particular focus on Africa. As of
October 2018, the UNCCD had 197 Parties.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) The UNFCCC was adopted in May 1992 and opened for
signature at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. It entered into
force in March 1994 and as of May 2018 had 197 Parties (196 States
and the European Union). The Convention’s ultimate objective is the
‘stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference
with the climate system’. The provisions of the Convention are
pursued and implemented by two treaties: the Kyoto Protocol and
the Paris Agreement.


Urban green infrastructure Public and private green spaces,

,,Summary for Policymakers,1,,"This Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) was prepared following an IPCC Panel decision in 2016 to prepare three Special Reports during the Sixth Assessment Cycle3 4. By assessing new scientific literature3, the SROCC5 responds to government and observer organization proposals. The SROCC follows the other two Special Reports on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SRI .5) and on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)6 and the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) compiles key findings of the report and is structured in three parts: SPM.A: Observed Changes and Impacts, SPM.B: Projected Changes and Risks, and SPM.C: Implementing Responses to Ocean and Cryosphere Change. To assist navigation of the SPM, icons indicate where content can be found. Confidence in key findings is reported using IPCC calibrated language7 and the underlying scientific basis for each key finding is indicated by references to sections of the underlying report.



Summary for Policymakers
Startup Box | The Importance of the Ocean and Cryosphere for People
All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere. The global ocean covers 71 % of the Earth surface and contains about 97% of the Earth's water. The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth system1. Around 10% of Earth's land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The ocean and cryosphere support unique habitats, and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through global exchange of water, energy and carbon. The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and current human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia that cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and irreversibility. {Box 1.1,1.2}
Human communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands (including Small Island Developing States, SIDS), polar areas and high mountains8 are particularly exposed to ocean and cryosphere change, such as sea level rise, extreme sea level and shrinking cryosphere. Other communities further from the coast are also exposed to changes in the ocean, such as through extreme weather events. Today, around 4 million people live permanently in the Arctic region, of whom 10% are Indigenous. The low-lying coastal zone9 is currently home to around 680 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050. SIDS are home to 65 million people. Around 670 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), including Indigenous peoples, live in high mountain regions in all continents except Antarctica. In high mountain regions, population is projected to reach between 740 and 840 million by 2050 (about 8.4-8.7% of the projected global population). {1.1, 2.1, 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 2.1}
In addition to their role within the climate system, such as the uptake and redistribution of natural and anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and heat, as well as ecosystem support, services provided to people by the ocean and/or cryosphere include food and water supply, renewable energy, and benefits for health and well-being, cultural values, tourism, trade, and transport. The state of the ocean and cryosphere interacts with each aspect of sustainability reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). {1.1,1.2,1.5}
                      |ce sheets and glaciers worldwide have lost mass (very high confidence). Between 2006 and 2015# the Greenland Ice Sheet9 lost ice mass at an average rate of 278 ±11 Gtyr1 (equivalent to 0.77 ± 0.03 mm yr1 of global sea level rise)10, mostly due to surface melting (high confidence). In 2006-2015, the Antarctic Ice Sheet lost mass at an average rate of 155 ± 19 Gt yr1 (0.43 ± 0.05 mm yr1), mostly due to rapid thinning and retreat of major outlet glaciers draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (very high confidence). Glaciers worldwide outside Greenland and Antarctica lost mass at an average rate of 220 ± 30 Gt yr-1 (equivalent to 0.61 ± 0.08 mm yr-1 sea level rise) in 2006-2015. {3.3.1,4.2.3, Appendix 2.A, Figure SPM.1}
 A.1.2	Arctic June snow cover extent on land declined by 13.4 ± 5.4% per decade from 1967
to 2018, a total loss of approximately 2.5 million km2, predominantly due to surface air temperature increase (high confidence). In nearly all high mountain areas, the depth, extent and duration of snow cover have declined over recent decades, especially at lower elevation (high confidence). {2.2.2, 3.4.1, Figure SPM.1}










































Summary for Policymakers
Box SPM.1 I Use of Climate Change Scenarios in SROCC
Assessments of projected future changes in this report are based largely on CMIP510 climate model projections using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCPs are scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use / land cover. RCPs provide only one set of many possible scenarios that would lead to different levels of global warming. {Annex I: Glossary}
This report uses mainly RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in its assessment, reflecting the available literature. RCP2.6 represents a low greenhouse gas emissions, high mitigation future, that in CMIP5 simulations gives a two in three chance of limiting global warming to below 2°C by 210011. By contrast, RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario in the absence of policies to combat climate change, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the total set of RCPs, RCP8.5 corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. The underlying chapters also reference other scenarios, including RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 that have intermediate levels of greenhouse gas emissions and result in intermediate levels of warming. {Annex I: Glossary, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
Table SPM.1 provides estimates of total warming since the pre-industrial period under four different RCPs for key assessment intervals used in SROCC. The warming from the 1850-1900 period until 1986-2005 has been assessed as 0.63°C (0.57°C to 0.69°C likely range) using observations of near-surface air temperature over the ocean and over land.12 Consistent with the approach in AR5, modelled future changes in global mean surface air temperature relative to 1986-2005 are added to this observed warming. {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
Table SPM.11 Projected global mean surface temperature change relative to 1850-1900 for two time periods under four RCPs15 {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}


A.2 It is virtually certain that the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system (high confidence). Since 1993, the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled (likely). Marine heatwaves have very likely doubled in frequency since 1982 and are increasing in intensity (very high confidence). By absorbing more CO2, the ocean has undergone increasing surface acidification (virtually certain). A loss of oxygen has occurred from the surface to 1000 m (medium confidence). (1.4,3.2, 5.2, 6.4, 6.7, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
               The ocean warming trend documented in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) has continued. Since 1993 the rate of ocean warming and thus heat uptake has more than doubled (likely) from 3.22 ±1.61 ZJ yr1 (0-700 m depth) and 0.97 ± 0.64 ZJ yr1 (700-2000 m) between 1969 and 1993, to 6.28 ± 0.48 ZJ yr1 (0-700 m) and 3.86 ± 2.09 ZJ yr1 (700-2000 m) between 1993 and 201717# and is attributed to anthropogenic forcing (very likely). {1.4.1, 5.2.2, Table 5.1, Figure SPM.1}
               
               The Southern Ocean accounted for 35-43% of the total heat gain in the upper 2000 m global ocean between 1970 and 2017 (high confidence). Its share increased to 45-62% between 2005 and 2017 (high confidence). The deep ocean below 2000 m has warmed since 1992 (likely), especially in the Southern Ocean. {1.4, 3.2.1, 5.2.2, Table 5.1, Figure SPM.2}
            
               Globally, marine heat-related events have increased; marine heatwaves18, defined when the daily sea surface temperature exceeds the local 99th percentile over the period 1982 to 2016, have doubled in frequency and have become longer-lasting, more intense and more extensive (very likely). It is very likely that between 84-90% of marine heatwaves that occurred between 2006 and 2015 are attributable to the anthropogenic temperature increase. {Table 6.2, 6.4, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
        
               Density stratification19 has increased in the upper 200 m of the ocean since 1970 (very likely). Observed surface ocean warming and high latitude addition of freshwater are making the surface ocean less dense relative to deeper parts of the ocean (high confidence) and inhibiting mixing between surface and deeper waters (high confidence). The mean stratification of the upper 200 m has increased by 2.3 ± 0.1 % (very likely range) from the 1971-1990 average to the 1998-2017 average. {5.2.2}
       
               The ocean has taken up between 20-30% (very likely) of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the 1980s causing further ocean acidification. Open ocean surface pH has declined by a very likely range of 0.017-0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1980s20, with the decline in surface ocean pH very likely to have already emerged from background natural variability for more than 95% of the ocean surface area. {3.2.1, 5.2.2, Box 5.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
 17 ZJ is Zettajoule and is equal to 1021 Joules. Warming the entire ocean by 1 °C requires about 5500 ZJ; 144 ZJ would warm the top 100 m by about 1°C.
18 A marine heatwave is a period of extreme warm near-sea surface temperature that persists for days to months and can extend up to thousands of kilometres (Annex I: Glossary).
19 In this report density stratification is defined as the density contrast between shallower and deeper layers. Increased stratification reduces the vertical exchange of heat, salinity, oxygen, carbon, and nutrients.
 20 Based on in-situ records longer than fifteen years.











































 Datasets spanning 1970-2010 show that the open ocean has lost oxygen by a very likely range of 0.5-3.3% over the upper 1000 m# alongside a likely expansion of the volume of oxygen minimum zones by 3-8% (medium confidence). Oxygen loss is primarily due to increasing ocean stratification, changing ventilation and biogeochemistry (high confidence). {5.2.2, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
Observations, both in situ (2004-2017) and based on sea surface temperature reconstructions, indicate that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)13 has weakened relative to 1850-1900 (medium confidence). There is insufficient data to quantify the magnitude of the weakening, or to properly attribute it to anthropogenic forcing due to the limited length of the observational record. Although attribution is currently not possible, CMIP5 model simulations of the period 1850-2015, on average, exhibit a weakening AMOC when driven by anthropogenic forcing. {6.7}
A. 3 Global mean sea level (GMSL) is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (very high confidence), as well as continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. Increases in tropical cyclone winds and rainfall, and increases in extreme waves, combined with relative sea level rise, exacerbate extreme sea level events and coastal hazards (high confidence). (3.3, 4.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2, SPM.4, SPM.5}
     ,•?$•]. H Total GMSL rise for 1902-2015 is 0.16 m (likely range 0.12-0.21 m). The rate of GMSL rise for 2006-2015 of 3.6 mmyr1 (3.1-4.1 mmyr1, very likely range), is unprecedented over the last century (high confidence), and about 2.5 times the rate for 1901-1990 of 1.4 mm yr1 (0.8- 2.0 mm yr1, very likely range). The sum of ice sheet and glacier contributions over the period 2006-2015 is the dominant source of sea level rise (1.8 mm yr-1, very likely range 1.7-1.9 mm yr-1), exceeding the effect of thermal expansion of ocean water (1.4 mm yr-1, very likely range 1.1-1.7 mm yr1)14 (very high confidence). The dominant cause of global mean sea level rise since 1970 is anthropogenic forcing (high confidence). {4.2.1,4.2.2, Figure SPM.1}
A.3.2	Ll^á	Sea level rise has accelerated (extremely likely) due to the combined increased ice loss from
the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (very high confidence). Mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet over the period 2007-2016 tripled relative to 1997-2006. For Greenland, mass loss doubled over the same period (likely, medium confidence). {3.3.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2, SPM A.1.1}
Acceleration of ice flow and retreat in Antarctica, which has the potential to lead to sea level rise of several metres within a few centuries, is observed in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica and in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica (very high confidence). These changes may be the onset of an irreversible15 ice sheet instability. Uncertainty related to the onset of ice sheet instability arises from limited observations, inadequate model representation of ice sheet processes, and limited understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere, ocean and the ice sheet. {3.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.2.3}
A.3.4	Sea level rise is	 not globally uniform and varies regionally. Regional differences, within ±30%
of the global mean sea level rise, result from land ice loss and variations in ocean warming and circulation. Differences from the global mean can be greater in areas of rapid vertical land movement including from local human activities (e.g. extraction of groundwater), (high confidence) {4.2.2, 5.2.2, 6.2.2, 6.3.1, 6.8.2, Figure SPM.2}


 A.3.5 ÏZZSà	Extreme	wave	heights,	which contribute to extreme sea level events, coastal erosion and
flooding, have increased in the Southern and North Atlantic Oceans by around 1.0 cm yr1 and 0.8 cm yr1 over the period 1985-2018 (medium confidence). Sea ice loss in the Arctic has also increased wave heights over the period 1992-2014 (medium confidence). {4.2.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Box 6.1}
 A.3.6	Anthropogenic	climate	change	has	increased	observed	precipitation	(medium confidence),
winds (low confidence), and extreme sea level events (high confidence) associated with some tropical cyclones, which has increased intensity of multiple extreme events and associated cascading impacts (high confidence). Anthropogenic climate change may have contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone intensity in the western North Pacific in recent decades related to anthropogenically-forced tropical expansion (low confidence). There is emerging evidence for an increase in annual global proportion of Category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades (low confidence). {6.2, Table 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Box 6.1}
 Observed Impacts on Ecosystems
A. 4 Cryospheric and associated hydrological changes have impacted terrestrial and freshwater species and ecosystems in high mountain and polar regions through the appearance of land previously covered by ice, changes in snow cover, and thawing permafrost. These changes have contributed to changing the seasonal activities, abundance and distribution of ecologically, culturally, and economically important plant and animal species, ecological disturbances, and ecosystem functioning, (high confidence) (2.3.2, 2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Box 3.4, Figure SPM.2}
 A.4.1	^5	EH	Over	the last century some species of plants and animals have increased in abundance, shifted
their range, and established in new areas as glaciers receded and the snow-free season lengthened (high confidence). Together with warming, these changes have increased locally the number of species in high mountains, as lower-elevation species migrate upslope (very high confidence). Some cold-adapted or snow-dependent species have declined in abundance, increasing their risk of extinction, notably on mountain summits (high confidence). In polar and mountain regions, many species have altered seasonal activities especially in late winter and spring (high confidence). {2.3.3, Box 3.4}
 A.4.2	Increased wildfire and abrupt permafrost thaw, as well as changes in Arctic and mountain
hydrology have altered frequency and intensity of ecosystem disturbances (high confidence).T\\\s has included positive and negative impacts on vegetation and wildlife such as reindeer and salmon (high confidence). {2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3}
 Across tundra, satellite observations show an overall greening, often indicative of increased plant productivity (high confidence). Some browning areas in tundra and boreal forest are indicative that productivity has decreased (high confidence). These changes have negatively affected provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services, with also some transient positive impacts for provisioning services, in both high mountains (medium confidence) and polar regions (high confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Annex I: Glossary}

A. 5 Since about 1950 many marine species across various groups have undergone shifts in geographical range and seasonal activities in response to ocean warming, sea ice change and biogeochemical changes, such as oxygen loss, to their habitats (high confidence). This has resulted in shifts in species composition, abundance and biomass production of ecosystems, from the equator to the poles. Altered interactions between species have caused cascading impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning (medium confidence). In some marine ecosystems species are impacted by both the effects of fishing and climate changes (medium confidence). (3.2.3, 3.2.4, Box 3.4, 5.2.3, 5.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.2}
Rates of poleward shifts in distributions across different marine species since the 1950s are 52 ± 33 km per decade and 29 ± 16 km per decade (very likely ranges) for organisms in the epipelagic (upper 200 m from sea surface) and seafloor ecosystems, respectively. The rate and direction of observed shifts in distributions are shaped by local temperature, oxygen, and ocean currents across depth, latitudinal and longitudinal gradients (high confidence). Warming-induced species range expansions have led to altered ecosystem structure and functioning such as in the North Atlantic, Northeast Pacific and Arctic (medium confidence). {5.2.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.6, Box 3.4, Figure SPM.2}
K4* In recent decades, Arctic net primary production has increased in ice-free waters (high confidence) and spring phytoplankton blooms are occurring earlier in the year in response to sea ice change and nutrient availability with spatially variable positive and negative consequences for marine ecosystems (medium confidence). In the Antarctic, such changes are spatially heterogeneous and have been associated with rapid local environmental change, including retreating glaciers and sea ice change (medium confidence). Changes in the seasonal activities, production and distribution of some Arctic zooplankton and a southward shift in the distribution of the Antarctic krill population in the South Atlantic are associated with climate-linked environmental changes (medium confidence). In polar regions, ice associated marine mammals and seabirds have experienced habitat contraction linked to sea ice changes (high confidence) and impacts on foraging success due to climate impacts on prey distributions (medium confidence). Cascading effects of multiple climate-related drivers on polar zooplankton have affected food web structure and function, biodiversity as well as fisheries (high confidence). {3.2.3, 3.2.4, Box 3.4, 5.2.3, Figure SPM.2}
Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are amongst the most productive ocean ecosystems. Increasing ocean acidification and oxygen loss are negatively impacting two of the four major upwelling systems: the California Current and Humboldt Current (high confidence). Ocean acidification and decrease in oxygen level in the California Current upwelling system have altered ecosystem structure, with direct negative impacts on biomass production and species composition (medium confidence). {Box 5.3, Figure SPM.2}
A.5.4	Ocean	warming	in	the	20th	century	and	beyond has contributed to an overall decrease in
maximum catch potential (medium confidence), compounding the impacts from overfishing for some fish stocks (high confidence). In many regions, declines in the abundance of fish and shellfish stocks due to direct and indirect effects of global warming and biogeochemical changes have already contributed to reduced fisheries catches (high confidence). In some areas, changing ocean conditions have contributed to the expansion of suitable habitat and/ or increases in the abundance of some species (high confidence). These changes have been accompanied by changes in species composition of fisheries catches since the 1970s in many ecosystems (medium confidence). {3.2.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.2}
12

A. 6 Coastal ecosystems are affected by ocean warming, including intensified marine heatwaves, acidification, loss of oxygen, salinity intrusion and sea level rise, in combination with adverse effects from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). Impacts are already observed on habitat area and biodiversity, as well as ecosystem functioning and services (high confidence). (4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3, 5.4.1, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.2}
              K4* Vegetated coastal ecosystems protect the coastline from storms and erosion and help buffer the impacts of sea level rise. Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events (high confidence). Vegetated coastal ecosystems are important carbon stores; their loss is responsible for the current release of 0.04-1.46 GtC yr1 (medium confidence). In response to warming, distribution ranges of seagrass meadows and kelp forests are expanding at high latitudes and contracting at low latitudes since the late 1970s (high confidence), and in some areas episodic losses occur following heatwaves (medium confidence). Large-scale mangrove mortality that is related to warming since the 1960s has been partially offset by their encroachment into subtropical saltmarshes as a result of increase in temperature, causing the loss of open areas with herbaceous plants that provide food and habitat for dependent fauna (high confidence). {4.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.6, 5.4.1, 5.5.1, Figure SPM.2}
              K4* Increased sea water intrusion in estuaries due to sea level rise has driven upstream redistribution of marine species (medium confidence) and caused a reduction of suitable habitats for estuarine communities (medium confidence). Increased nutrient and organic matter loads in estuaries since the 1970s from intensive human development and riverine loads have exacerbated the stimulating effects of ocean warming on bacterial respiration, leading to expansion of low oxygen areas (high confidence). {5.3.1}
              K4* The impacts of sea level rise on coastal ecosystems include habitat contraction, geographical shift of associated species, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. Impacts are exacerbated by direct human disturbances, and where anthropogenic barriers prevent landward shift of marshes and mangroves (termed coastal squeeze) (high confidence). Depending on local geomorphology and sediment supply, marshes and mangroves can grow vertically at rates equal to or greater than current mean sea level rise (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.7, 5.4.1}
              K4* Warm-water coral reefs and rocky shores dominated by immobile, calcifying (e.g., shell and skeleton producing) organisms such as corals, barnacles and mussels, are currently impacted by extreme temperatures and ocean acidification (high confidence). Marine heatwaves have already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events at increasing frequency (very high confidence) causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997, and recovery is slow (more than 15 years) if it occurs (high confidence). Prolonged periods of high environmental temperature and dehydration of the organisms pose high risk to rocky shore ecosystems (high confidence). {SR.1.5; 5.3.4, 5.3.5, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.2}

Observed Impacts on People and Ecosystem Services
A.7 Since the mid-20th century, the shrinking cryosphere in the Arctic and high mountain areas has led to predominantly negative impacts on food security, water resources, water quality, livelihoods, health and well-being, infrastructure, transportation, tourism and recreation, as well as culture of human societies, particularly for Indigenous peoples (high confidence). Costs and benefits have been unequally distributed across populations and regions. Adaptation efforts have benefited from the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (high confidence). {1.1,1.5,1.6.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.4, 3.5, Figure SPM.2}
A.7.1	^3	Food and water security have been negatively impacted by changes in snow cover, lake and
river ice, and permafrost in many Arctic regions (high confidence). These changes have disrupted access to, and food availability within, herding, hunting, fishing, and gathering areas, harming the livelihoods and cultural identity of Arctic residents including Indigenous populations (high confidence). Glacier retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including Hindu Kush Himalaya and the tropical Andes (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.7, Box 2.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, Figure SPM.2}
In the Arctic, negative impacts of cryosphere change on human health have included
increased risk of food- and waterborne diseases, malnutrition, injury, and mental health challenges especially among Indigenous peoples (high confidence). In some high mountain areas, water quality has been affected by contaminants, particularly mercury, released from melting glaciers and thawing permafrost (medium confidence). Health-related adaptation efforts in the Arctic range from local to international in scale, and successes have been underpinned by Indigenous knowledge (high confidence). {1.8, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 3.4.3}
Arctic	 residents,	especially 	Indigenous	 peoples,	have adjusted the timing of activities to respond to changes in seasonality and safety of land, ice, and snow travel conditions. Municipalities and industry are beginning to address infrastructure failures associated with flooding and thawing permafrost and some coastal communities have planned for relocation (high confidence). Limited funding, skills, capacity, and institutional support to engage meaningfully in planning processes have challenged adaptation (high confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9}

Summertime Arctic ship-based transportation (including tourism) increased over the past two
decades concurrent with sea ice reductions (high con/7c/e/7ce). This has implications for global trade and economies linked to traditional shipping corridors, and poses risks to Arctic marine ecosystems and coastal communities (high confidence), such as from invasive species and local pollution. {3.2.1, 3.2.4, 3.5.4, 5.4.2, Figure SPM.2}

In past decades, exposure of people and infrastructure to natural hazards has increased due to growing population, tourism and socioeconomic development (high confidence). Some disasters have been linked to changes in the cryosphere, for example in the Andes, high mountain Asia, Caucasus and European Alps (medium confidence). {2.3.2, Figure SPM.2}
Changes in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and seasonality of runoff and water resources in snow dominated and glacier-fed river basins (very high confidence). Hydropower facilities have experienced changes in seasonality and both increases and decreases in water input from high mountain areas, for example, in central Europe, Iceland, Western USA/Canada, and tropical Andes (medium confidence). However, there is only limited evidence of resulting impacts on operations and energy production. {SPM B.1.4, 2.3.1}
a.7.7 rm	High	mountain	aesthetic	and	cultural	aspects	have been negatively impacted by glacier
and snow cover decline (e.g. in the Himalaya, East Africa, the tropical Andes) (medium confidence). Tourism and recreation, including ski and glacier tourism, hiking, and mountaineering, have also been negatively impacted in many mountain regions (medium confidence). In some places, artificial snowmaking has reduced negative impacts on ski tourism (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6, Figure SPM.2}
A. 8 Changes in the ocean have impacted marine ecosystems and ecosystem services with regionally diverse outcomes, challenging their governance (high confidence). Both positive and negative impacts result for food security through fisheries (medium confidence), local cultures and livelihoods (medium confidence), and tourism and recreation (medium confidence). The impacts on ecosystem services have negative consequences for health and well-being (medium confidence), and for Indigenous peoples and local communities dependent on fisheries (high confidence). {1.1,1.5, 3.2.1, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, Figure SPM.2}
A.8.1	iS*	Warming-induced	changes	in	the	spatial	distribution	and	abundance of some fish and
shellfish stocks have had positive and negative impacts on catches, economic benefits, livelihoods, and local culture (high confidence). There are negative consequences for Indigenous peoples and local communities that are dependent on fisheries (high confidence). Shifts in species distributions and abundance has challenged international and national ocean and fisheries governance, including in the Arctic, North Atlantic and Pacific, in terms of regulating fishing to secure ecosystem integrity and sharing of resources between fishing entities (high confidence). {3.2.4, 3.5.3, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, Figure SPM.2}
              K4* Harmful algal blooms display range expansion and increased frequency in coastal areas since the 1980s in response to both climatic and non-climatic drivers such as increased riverine nutrients run-off (high confidence). The observed trends in harmful algal blooms are attributed partly to the effects of ocean warming, marine heatwaves, oxygen loss, eutrophication and pollution (high confidence). Harmful algal blooms have had negative impacts on food security, tourism, local economy, and human health (high confidence). The human communities who are more vulnerable to these biological hazards are those in areas without sustained monitoring programs and dedicated early warning systems for harmful algal blooms (medium confidence). {Box 5.4, 5.4.2,6.4.2}
A. 9 Coastal communities are exposed to multiple climate-related hazards, including tropical cyclones, extreme sea levels and flooding, marine heatwaves, sea ice loss, and permafrost thaw (high confidence). A diversity of responses has been implemented worldwide, mostly after extreme events, but also some in anticipation of future sea level rise, e.g., in the case of large infrastructure. {3.2.4, 3.4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.4.2, 5.4.2, 6.2, 6.4.2, 6.8, Box 6.1, Cross Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
A.9.1	Attribution	of	current	coastal	impacts	on	people	to sea level rise remains difficult in
most locations since impacts were exacerbated by human-induced non-climatic drivers, such as land subsidence (e.g., groundwater extraction), pollution, habitat degradation, reef and sand mining (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3}
A.9.2	L2a	Coastal protection through hard measures, such as dikes, seawalls, and surge barriers, is
widespread in many coastal cities and deltas. Ecosystem-based and hybrid approaches combining ecosystems and built infrastructure are becoming more popular worldwide. Coastal advance, which refers to the creation of new land by building seawards (e.g., land reclamation), has a long history in most areas where there are dense coastal populations and a shortage of land. Coastal retreat, which refers to the removal of human occupation of coastal areas, is also observed, but is generally restricted to small human communities or occurs to create coastal wetland habitat. The effectiveness of the responses to sea level rise are assessed in Figure SPM.5. {3.5.3, 4.3.3, 4.4.2, 6.3.3, 6.9.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
B. Projected Changes and Risks
Projected Physical Changes16
B. 1 Global-scale glacier mass loss, permafrost thaw, and decline in snow cover and Arctic sea ice extent are projected to continue in the near-term (2031-2050) due to surface air temperature increases (high confidence), with unavoidable consequences for river runoff and local hazards (high confidence). The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are projected to lose mass at an increasing rate throughout the 21st century and beyond (high confidence). The rates and magnitudes of these cryospheric changes are projected to increase further in the second half of the 21st century in a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (high confidence). Strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades are projected to reduce further changes after 2050 (high confidence). (2.2, 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2, 3.3, 3.4, Figure SPM.1, SPM Box SPM.1}
                     Projected glacier mass reductions between 2015 and 2100 (excluding the ice sheets) range from 18 ± 7% (likely range) for RCP2.6 to 36 ± 11 % (likely range) for RCP8.5, corresponding to a sea level contribution of 94 ± 25 mm (likely range) sea level equivalent for RCP2.6, and 200 ± 44 mm (likely range) for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). Regions with mostly smaller glaciers (e.g., Central Europe, Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical Andes, Mexico, eastern Africa and Indonesia), are projected to lose more than 80% of their current ice mass by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence), and many glaciers are projected to disappear regardless of future emissions (very high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2, Figure SPM.1}
B. i .2 a	In	2100, the Greenland Ice Sheet's projected contribution to GMSL rise is 0.07 m (0.04-0.12 m,
likely range) under RCP2.6, and 0.15 m (0.08-0.27 m, likely range) under RCP8.5. In 2100, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is projected to contribute 0.04 m (0.01-0.11 m, likely range) under RCP2.6, and 0.12 m (0.03-0.28 m, likely range) under RCP8.5.The Greenland Ice Sheet is currently contributing more to sea level rise than the Antarctic Ice Sheet (high confidence), but Antarctica could become a larger contributor by the end of the 21 st century as a consequence of rapid retreat (low confidence). Beyond 2100, increasing divergence between Greenland and Antarctica's relative contributions to GMSL rise under RCP8.5 has important consequences for the pace of relative sea level rise in the Northern Flemisphere. {3.3.1,4.2.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Figure SPM.1}
B. I.3	Arctic	autumn and spring snow cover are projected to decrease by 5-10%, relative to
1986-2005, in the near-term (2031-2050), followed by no further losses under RCP2.6, but an additional 15-25% loss by the end of century under RCP8.5 (high confidence). In high mountain areas, projected decreases in low elevation mean winter snow depth, compared to 1986-2005, are likely 10-40% by 2031-2050, regardless of emissions scenario (high confidence). For 2081-2100, this projected decrease is likely 10-40% for RCP2.6 and 50-90% for RCP8.5. {2.2.2, 3.3.2, 3.4.2, Figure SPM.1}

B.1.4
 ^3 Widespread permafrost thaw is projected for this century (very high confidence) and beyond. By 2100, projected near-surface (within 3-4 m) permafrost area shows a decrease of 24 ± 16% (likely range) for RCP2.6 and 69 ± 20% (likely range) for RCP8.5. The RCP8.5 scenario leads to the cumulative release of tens to hundreds of billions of tons (GtC) of permafrost carbon as CO226 and methane to the atmosphere by 2100 with the potential to exacerbate climate change (medium confidence). Lower emissions scenarios dampen the response of carbon emissions from the permafrost region (high confidence). Methane contributes a small fraction of the total additional carbon release but is significant because of its higher warming potential. Increased plant growth is projected to replenish soil carbon in part, but will not match carbon releases over the long term (medium confidence). {2.2.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, Figure SPM.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1}
B.1.5
 ^3 In many high mountain areas, glacier retreat and permafrost thaw are projected to further decrease the stability of slopes, and the number and area of glacier lakes will continue to increase (high confidence). Floods due to glacier lake outburst or rain-on-snow, landslides and snow avalanches, are projected to occur also in new locations or different seasons (high confidence). {2.3.2}
B.1.6
 ^3 River runoff in snow-dominated or glacier-fed high mountain basins is projected to change regardless of emissions scenario (very high confidence), with increases in average winter runoff (high confidence) and earlier spring peaks (very high confidence). In all emissions scenarios, average annual and summer runoff from glaciers are projected to peak at or before the end of the 21 st century (high confidence), e.g., around mid-century in High Mountain Asia, followed by a decline in glacier runoff. In regions with little glacier cover (e.g., tropical Andes, European Alps) most glaciers have already passed this peak (high confidence). Projected declines in glacier runoff by 2100 (RCP8.5) can reduce basin runoff by 10% or more in at least one month of the melt season in several large river basins, especially in High Mountain Asia during the dry season (low confidence). {2.3.1}
B.1.7
                      Arctic sea ice loss is projected to continue through mid-century, with differences thereafter depending on the magnitude of global warming: for stabilised global warming of 1.5°C the annual probability of a sea ice-free September by the end of century is approximately 1%, which rises to 10-35% for stabilised global warming of 2°C (high confidence). There is low confidence in projections for Antarctic sea ice. {3.2.2, Figure SPM.1}
B.2
 Over the 21st century, the ocean is projected to transition to unprecedented conditions with increased temperatures (virtually certain), greater upper ocean stratification (very likely), further acidification (virtually certain), oxygen decline (medium confidence), and altered net primary production (low confidence). Marine heatwaves (very high confidence) and extreme El Niño and La Niña events (medium confidence) are projected to become more frequent. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to weaken (very likely). The rates and magnitudes of these changes will be smaller under scenarios with low greenhouse gas emissions (very likely). (3.2, 5.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.7, Box 5.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.3}
B.2.1
                      The ocean will continue to warm throughout the 21st century (virtually certain). By 2100, the top 2000 m of the ocean are projected to take up 5-7 times more heat under RCP8.5 (or 2-4 times more under RCP2.6) than the observed accumulated ocean heat uptake since 1970 (very likely). The annual mean density stratification19 of the top 200 m, averaged between 60°S and 60°N, is projected to increase by 12-30% for RCP8.5 and 1-9% for RCP2.6, for 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005 (very likely), inhibiting vertical nutrient, carbon and oxygen fluxes. {5.2.2, Figure SPM.1}













































B. Sea level continues to rise at an increasing rate. Extreme sea level events that are historically rare (once per century in the recent past) are projected to occur frequently (at least once per year) at many locations by 2050 in all RCP scenarios, especially in tropical regions (high confidence). The increasing frequency of high water levels can have severe impacts in many locations depending on exposure (high confidence). Sea level rise is projected to continue beyond 2100 in all RCP scenarios. For a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), projections of global sea level rise by 2100 are greater than in AR5 due to a larger contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (medium confidence). In coming centuries under RCP8.5, sea-level rise is projected to exceed rates of several centimetres per year resulting in multi-metre rise (medium confidence), while for RCP2.6 sea level rise is projected to be limited to around 1 m in 2300 (low confidence). Extreme sea levels and coastal hazards will be exacerbated by projected increases in tropical cyclone intensity and precipitation (high confidence). Projected changes in waves and tides vary locally in whether they amplify or ameliorate these hazards (medium confidence). (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.1, 4.2, 5.2.2, 6.3.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.4, SPM.5}
                     The global mean sea level (GMSL) rise under RCP2.6 is projected to be 0.39 m (0.26-0.53 m# likely range) for the period 2081 -2100# and 0.43 m (0.29-0.59 m# likely range) in 2100 with respect to 1986-2005. For RCP8.5, the corresponding GMSL rise is 0.71 m (0.51-0.92 m# likely range) for 2081-2100 and 0.84 m (0.61-1.10 m, likely range) in 2100. Mean sea level rise projections are higher by 0.1 m compared toAR5 under RCP8.5 in 2100, and the likely range extends beyond 1 m in 2100 due to a larger projected ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (medium confidence). The uncertainty at the end of the century is mainly determined by the ice sheets, especially in Antarctica. {4.2.3, Figures SPM.1, SPM.5}
              K4* Sea level projections show regional differences around GMSL. Processes not driven by recent climate change, such as local subsidence caused by natural processes and human activities, are important to relative sea level changes at the coast (high confidence). While the relative importance of climate-driven sea level rise is projected to increase over time, local processes need to be considered for projections and impacts of sea level (high confidence). {SPM A.3.4, 4.2.1,4.2.2, Figure SPM.5}
                     The rate of global mean sea level rise is projected to reach 15 mm yr1 (10-20 mm yr\ likely range) under RCP8.5 in 2100, and to exceed several centimetres per year in the 22nd century. Under RCP2.6, the rate is projected to reach 4 mm yr'1 (2-6 mm yr1, likely range) in 2100. Model studies indicate multi-meter rise in sea level by 2300 (2.3-5.4 m for RCP8.5 and 0.6-1.07 m under RCP2.6) (low confidence), indicating the importance of reduced emissions for limiting sea level rise. Processes controlling the timing of future ice-shelf loss and the extent of ice sheet instabilities could increase Antarctica's contribution to sea level rise to values substantially higher than the likely range on century and longer time-scales (low confidence). Considering the consequences of sea level rise that a collapse of parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet entails, this high impact risk merits attention. {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.1,4.2.3}
B. 3.4	Global mean sea level rise will cause the frequency of extreme sea level events at most
locations to increase. Local sea levels that historically occurred once per century (historical centennial events) are projected to occur at least annually at most locations by 2100 under all RCP scenarios (high confidence). Many low-lying megacities and small islands (including SIDS) are projected to experience historical centennial events at least annually by 2050 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The year when the historical centennial event becomes an annual event in the mid-latitudes occurs soonest in RCP8.5, next in RCP4.5 and latest in RCP2.6. The increasing frequency of high water levels can have severe impacts in many locations depending on the level of exposure (high confidence). {4.2.3, 6.3, Figures SPM.4, SPM.5}



                     Significant wave heights (the average height from trough to crest of the highest one-third of waves) are projected to increase across the Southern Ocean and tropical eastern Pacific (high confidence) and Baltic Sea (medium confidence) and decrease over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea under RCP8.5 (high confidence). Coastal tidal amplitudes and patterns are projected to change due to sea level rise and coastal adaptation measures (very likely). Projected changes in waves arising from changes in weather patterns, and changes in tides due to sea level rise, can locally enhance or ameliorate coastal hazards (medium confidence). {6.3.1, 5.2.2}
B. 3.6	The	average	intensity	of	tropical	cyclones,	the proportion of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones
and the associated average precipitation rates are projected to increase for a 2°C global temperature rise above any baseline period (medium confidence). Rising mean sea levels will contribute to higher extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones (very high confidence). Coastal hazards will be exacerbated by an increase in the average intensity, magnitude of storm surge and precipitation rates of tropical cyclones. There are greater increases projected under RCP8.5 than under RCP2.6 from around mid-century to 2100 (medium confidence). There is low confidence in changes in the future frequency of tropical cyclones at the global scale. {6.3.1}
Projected Risks for Ecosystems
B.4 Future land cryosphere changes will continue to alter terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in high mountain and polar regions with major shifts in species distributions resulting in changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, and eventual loss of globally unique biodiversity (medium confidence). Wildfire is projected to increase significantly for the rest of this century across most tundra and boreal regions, and also in some mountain regions (medium confidence). (2.3.3, Box 3.4, 3.4.3}
B.4.1 m	In	high	mountain	regions,	further	upslope	migration by lower-elevation species, range
contractions, and increased mortality will lead to population declines of many alpine species, especially glacier- or snow-dependent species (high confidence), with local and eventual global species loss (medium confidence). The persistence of alpine species and sustaining ecosystem services depends on appropriate conservation and adaptation measures (high confidence). {2.3.3}
 B.4.2	On	Arctic	land,	a	loss of globally unique biodiversity is projected as limited refugia exist for
some High-Arctic species and hence they are outcompeted by more temperate species (medium confidence).\Noo6y shrubs and trees are projected to expand to cover 24-52% of Arctic tundra by 2050 (medium confidence).Jhe boreal forest is projected to expand at its northern edge, while diminishing at its southern edge where it is replaced by lower biomass woodland/shrublands (medium confidence). {3.4.3, Box 3.4}
B.4.3 QÉ0 Lî-îl	Permafrost	thaw and decrease in snow will affect Arctic and mountain hydrology and wildfire,
with impacts on vegetation and wildlife (medium confidence). About 20% of Arctic land permafrost is vulnerable to abrupt permafrost thaw and ground subsidence, which is projected to increase small lake area by over 50% by 2100 for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). Even as the overall regional water cycle is projected to intensify, including increased precipitation, évapotranspiration, and river discharge to the Arctic Ocean, decreases in snow and permafrost may lead to soil drying with consequences for ecosystem productivity and disturbances (medium confidence). Wildfire is projected to increase for the rest of this century across most tundra and boreal regions, and also in some mountain regions, while interactions between climate and shifting vegetation will influence future fire intensity and frequency (medium confidence). {2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, SPM B.1}

B.5 A decrease in global biomass of marine animal communities, their production, and fisheries catch potential, and a shift in species composition are projected over the 21st century in ocean ecosystems from the surface to the deep seafloor under all emission scenarios (medium confidence). The rate and magnitude of decline are projected to be highest in the tropics (high confidence), whereas impacts remain diverse in polar regions (medium confidence) and increase for high emissions scenarios. Ocean acidification (medium confidence), oxygen loss (medium confidence) and reduced sea ice extent (medium confidence) as well as non-climatic human activities (medium confidence) have the potential to exacerbate these warming-induced ecosystem impacts. (3.2.3, 3.3.3, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}
B.5.1	K4*	Projected	ocean	warming	and	changes	in	net primary production alter biomass, production
and community structure of marine ecosystems. The global-scale biomass of marine animals across the foodweb is projected to decrease by 15.0 ± 5.9% (very likely range) and the maximum catch potential of fisheries by 20.5-24.1 % by the end of the 21 st century relative to 1986-2005 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). These changes are projected to be very likely three to four times larger under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6. {3.2.3, 3.3.3, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}
B.5.2	K4*	Under enhanced stratification reduced nutrient supply is projected to cause tropical ocean
net primary production to decline by 7-16% (very likely range) for RCP8.5 by 2081-2100 (medium confidence). In tropical regions, marine animal biomass and production are projected to decrease more than the global average under all emissions scenarios in the 21st century (high confidence). Warming and sea ice changes are projected to increase marine net primary production in the Arctic (medium confidence) and around Antarctica (low confidence), modified by changing nutrient supply due to shifts in upwelling and stratification. Globally, the sinking flux of organic matter from the upper ocean is projected to decrease, linked largely due to changes in net primary production (high confidence). As a result, 95% or more of the deep sea (3000-6000 m depth) seafloor area and cold-water coral ecosystems are projected to experience declines in benthic biomass under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {3.2.3, 5.2.2. 5.2.4, Figure SPM.1}
              K4* Warming, ocean acidification, reduced seasonal sea ice extent and continued loss of multi-year sea ice are projected to impact polar marine ecosystems through direct and indirect effects on habitats, populations and their viability (medium confidence). The geographical range of Arctic marine species, including marine mammals, birds and fish is projected to contract, while the range of some sub-Arctic fish communities is projected to expand, further increasing pressure on high-Arctic species (medium confidence). In the Southern Ocean, the habitat of Antarctic krill, a key prey species for penguins, seals and whales, is projected to contract southwards under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {3.2.2, 3.2.3, 5.2.3}
B.5.4	Ocean	warming,	oxygen	loss,	acidification	and a decrease in flux of organic carbon from the
surface to the deep ocean are projected to harm habitat-forming cold-water corals, which support high biodiversity, partly through decreased calcification, increased dissolution of skeletons, and bioerosion (medium confidence). Vulnerability and risks are highest where and when temperature and oxygen conditions both reach values outside species' tolerance ranges (medium confidence). {Box 5.2, Figure SPM.3}

B.6 Risks of severe impacts on biodiversity, structure and function of coastal ecosystems are projected to be higher for elevated temperatures under high compared to low emissions scenarios in the 21st century and beyond. Projected ecosystem responses include losses of species habitat and diversity, and degradation of ecosystem functions. The capacity of organisms and ecosystems to adjust and adapt is higher at lower emissions scenarios (high confidence). For sensitive ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and kelp forests, high risks are projected if global warming exceeds 2°C above pre-industrial temperature, combined with other climate-related hazards (high confidence). Warm-water corals are at high risk already and are projected to transition to very high risk even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C (very high confidence). {4.3.3, 5.3, 5.5, Figure SPM.3}
              K4* All coastal ecosystems assessed are projected to face increasing risk level, from moderate to high risk under RCP2.6 to high to very high risk under RCP8.5 by 2100. Intertidal rocky shore ecosystems are projected to be at very high risk by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence) due to exposure to warming, especially during marine heatwaves, as well as to acidification, sea level rise, loss of calcifying species and biodiversity (high confidence). Ocean acidification challenges these ecosystems and further limits their habitat suitability (medium confidence) by inhibiting recovery through reduced calcification and enhanced bioerosion. The decline of kelp forests is projected to continue in temperate regions due to warming, particularly under the projected intensification of marine heatwaves, with high risk of local extinctions under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {5.3, 5.3.5, 5.3.6, 5.3.7, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.3}
              K4* Seagrass meadows and saltmarshes and associated carbon stores are at moderate risk at 1.5°C global warming and increase with further warming (medium confidence). Globally, 20-90% of current coastal wetlands are projected to be lost by 2100, depending on projected sea level rise, regional differences and wetland types, especially where vertical growth is already constrained by reduced sediment supply and landward migration is constrained by steep topography or human modification of shorelines (high confidence). {4.3.3, 5.3.2, Figure SPM.3, SPMA.6.1}

               K4* Ocean warming, sea level rise and tidal changes are projected to expand salinization and hypoxia in estuaries (high confidence) with high risks for some biota leading to migration, reduced survival, and local extinction under high emission scenarios (medium confidence). These impacts are projected to be more pronounced in more vulnerable eutrophic and shallow estuaries with low tidal range in temperate and high latitude regions (medium confidence). {5.2.2, 5.3.1, Figure SPM.3}
               K4* Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C (high confidence). The species composition and diversity of remaining reef communities is projected to differ from present-day reefs (very high confidence). {5.3.4, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}
Projected Risks for People and Ecosystem Services
B.7 Future cryosphere changes on land are projected to affect water resources and their uses, such as hydropower (high confidence) and irrigated agriculture in and downstream of high mountain areas (medium confidence), as well as livelihoods in the Arctic (medium confidence). Changes in floods, avalanches, landslides, and ground destabilization are projected to increase risk for infrastructure, cultural, tourism, and recreational assets (medium confidence). (2.3,2.3.1,3.4.3}
B.7.1	Disaster	risks	to human settlements and livelihood options in high mountain areas and
the Arctic are expected to increase (medium confidence), due to future changes in hazards such as floods, fires, landslides, avalanches, unreliable ice and snow conditions, and increased exposure of people and infrastructure (high confidence). Current engineered risk reduction approaches are projected to be less effective as hazards change in character (medium confidence). Significant risk reduction and adaptation strategies help avoid increased impacts from mountain flood and landslide hazards as exposure and vulnerability are increasing in many mountain regions during this century (high confidence). {2.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.2}
B.7.2	Permafrost	thaw-induced	subsidence	of the land surface is projected to impact overlying
urban and rural communication and transportation infrastructure in the Arctic and in high mountain areas (medium coA7//c/eA7ce).The majority of Arctic infrastructure is located in regions where permafrost thaw is projected to intensify by mid-century. Retrofitting and redesigning infrastructure has the potential to halve the costs arising from permafrost thaw and related climate-change impacts by 2100 (medium confidence). {2.3.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.3}
b.7.3 rm	High	mountain	tourism,	recreation	and	cultural	assets	are	projected	to	be	negatively	affected
by future cryospheric changes (high confidence). Current snowmaking technologies are projected to be less effective in reducing risks to ski tourism in a warmer climate in most parts of Europe, North America, and Japan, in particular at 2°C global warming and beyond (high confidence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}
25

B.8 Future shifts in fish distribution and decreases in their abundance and fisheries catch potential due to climate change are projected to affect income, livelihoods, and food security of marine resource-dependent communities (medium confidence). Long-term loss and degradation of marine ecosystems compromises the ocean's role in cultural, recreational, and intrinsic values important for human identity and well-being (medium confidence). (3.2.4,3.4.3,5.4.1,5.4.2,6.4}
B.8.1	K4*	Projected	geographical	shifts and decreases of global marine animal biomass and fish catch
potential are more pronounced under RCP8.5 relative to RCP2.6 elevating the risk for income and livelihoods of dependent human communities, particularly in areas that are economically vulnerable (medium confidence). The projected redistribution of resources and abundance increases the risk of conflicts among fisheries, authorities or communities (medium confidence). Challenges to fisheries governance are widespread under RCP8.5 with regional hotspots such as the Arctic and tropical Pacific Ocean (medium confidence). {3.5.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.3}
B.8.2	The decline in warm-water coral reefs is projected to greatly compromise the services they
provide to society, such as food provision (high confidence), coastal protection (high confidence) and tourism (medium confidence). Increases in the risks for seafood security (medium confidence) associated with decreases in seafood availability are projected to elevate the risk to nutritional health in some communities highly dependent on seafood (medium confidence), such as those in the Arctic, West Africa, and Small Island Developing States. Such impacts compound any risks from other shifts in diets and food systems caused by social and economic changes and climate change over land (medium confidence). {3.4.3, 5.4.2, 6.4.2}
			 ^
Global warming compromises seafood safety (medium confidence) through human exposure to elevated bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants and mercury in marine plants and animals (medium confidence), increasing prevalence of waterborne Vibrio pathogens (medium confidence), and heightened likelihood of harmful algal blooms (medium confidence). These risks are projected to be particularly large for human communities with high consumption of seafood, including coastal Indigenous communities (medium confidence), and for economic sectors such as fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism (high confidence). {3.4.3, 5.4.2, Box 5.3}
              ÍI3* Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and their services put key cultural dimensions of lives and livelihoods at risk (medium confidence), including through shifts in the distribution or abundance of harvested species and diminished access to fishing or hunting areas. This includes potentially rapid and irreversible loss of culture and local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge, and negative impacts on traditional diets and food security, aesthetic aspects, and marine recreational activities (medium confidence). {3.4.3, 3.5.3, 5.4.2}
26

 B.9	Increased mean and extreme sea level, alongside ocean warming and acidification, are projected
to exacerbate risks for human communities in low-lying coastal areas (high confidence). In Arctic human communities without rapid land uplift, and in urban atoll islands, risks are projected to be moderate to high even under a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) (medium confidence), including reaching adaptation limits (high confidence). Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), delta regions and resource rich coastal cities are projected to experience moderate to high risk levels after 2050 under current adaptation (medium confidence). Ambitious adaptation including transformative governance is expected to reduce risk (high confidence), but with context-specific benefits. (4.3.3, 4.3.4, SM4.3, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
 B.9.1	In	the	absence of more ambitious adaptation efforts compared to today, and under current
trends of increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities, risks, such as erosion and land loss, flooding, salinization, and cascading impacts due to mean sea level rise and extreme events are projected to significantly increase throughout this century under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (very high confidence). Under the same assumptions, annual coastal flood damages are projected to increase by 2-3 orders of magnitude by 2100 compared to today (high confidence). {4.3.3, 4.3.4, Box 6.1, 6.8, SM.4.3, Figures SPM.4, SPM.5}

 
     High to very high risks are approached for vulnerable communities in coral reef environments, urban atoll islands and low-lying Arctic locations from sea level rise well before the end of this century in case of high emissions scenarios. This entails adaptation limits being reached, which are the points at which an actor's objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions (high confidence). Reaching adaptation limits (e.g., biophysical, geographical, financial, technical, social, political, and institutional) depends on the emissions scenario and context-specific risk tolerance, and is projected to expand to more areas beyond 2100, due to the long-term commitment of sea level rise (medium confidence). Some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable due to climate-related ocean and cryosphere change (medium confidence), but habitability thresholds remain extremely difficult to assess. {4.3.4,4.4.2,4.4.3, 5.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, SM.4.3, SPM C.1, Glossary, Figure SPM.5}
                     Globally, a slower rate of climate-related ocean and cryosphere change provides greater adaptation opportunities (high confidence). While there is high confidence that ambitious adaptation, including governance for transformative change, has the potential to reduce risks in many locations, such benefits can vary between locations. At global scale, coastal protection can reduce flood risk by 2-3 orders of magnitude during the 21st century, but depends on investments on the order of tens to several hundreds of billions of US$ per year (high confidence). While such investments are generally cost efficient for densely populated urban areas, rural and poorer areas may be challenged to afford such investments with relative annual costs for some small island states amounting to several percent of GDP (high confidence). Even with major adaptation efforts, residual risks and associated losses are projected to occur (medium confidence), but context-specific limits to adaptation and residual risks remain difficult to assess. {4.1.3, 4.2.2.4, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.4., 4.4.3, 6.9.1, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1-2 in Chapter 1, SM.4.3, Figure SPM.5}

C. Implementing Responses to Ocean and Cryosphere Change
Challenges
C. Impacts of climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere increasingly challenge current governance efforts to develop and implement adaptation responses from local to global scales, and in some cases pushing them to their limits. People with the highest exposure and vulnerability are often those with lowest capacity to respond (high confidence). (1.5,1.7, Cross-Chapter Boxes 2-3 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 2.4, 3.2.4, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 4.1, 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.9}
C. 	The	temporal	scales of climate change impacts in ocean and cryosphere and their societal
consequences operate on time horizons which are longer than those of governance arrangements (e.g.# planning cycles, public and corporate decision making cycles, and financial instruments). Such temporal differences challenge the ability of societies to adequately prepare for and respond to long-term changes including shifts in the frequency and intensity of extreme events (high confidence). Examples include changing landslides and floods in high mountain regions and risks to important species and ecosystems in the Arctic, as well as to low-lying nations and islands, small island nations, other coastal regions and to coral reef ecosystems. {2.3.2, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.9}
 
C. Governance	arrangements (e.g., marine protected areas, spatial plans and water management
systems) are, in many contexts, too fragmented across administrative boundaries and sectors to provide integrated responses to the increasing and cascading risks from climate-related changes in the ocean and/or cryosphere (high confidence). The capacity of governance systems in polar and ocean regions to respond to climate change impacts has strengthened recently, but this development is not sufficiently rapid or robust to adequately address the scale of increasing projected risks (high confidence). In high mountains, coastal regions and small islands, there are also difficulties in coordinating climate adaptation responses, due to the many interactions of climatic and non-climatic risk drivers (such as inaccessibility, demographic and settlement trends, or land subsidence caused by local activities) across scales, sectors and policy domains (high confidence). {2.3.1, 3.5.3, 4.4.3, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, Box 5.6, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1}
C. 	There	are	a	broad	range of identified barriers and limits for adaptation to climate change
in ecosystems (high confidence). Limitations include the space that ecosystems require, non-climatic drivers and human impacts that need to be addressed as part of the adaptation response, the lowering of adaptive capacity of ecosystems because of climate change, and the slower ecosystem recovery rates relative to the recurrence of climate impacts, availability of technology, knowledge and financial support, and existing governance arrangements (medium confidence). {3.5.4, 5.5.2}
C. 	Financial,	technological,	institutional	and	other	barriers	exist	for implementing responses to
current and projected negative impacts of climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere, impeding resilience building and risk reduction measures (high confidence). Whether such barriers reduce adaptation effectiveness or correspond to adaptation limits depends on context specific circumstances, the rate and scale of climate changes and on the ability of societies to turn their adaptive capacity into effective adaptation responses. Adaptive capacity continues to differ between as well as within communities and societies (high confidence). People with highest exposure and vulnerability to current and future hazards from ocean and cryosphere changes are often also those with lowest adaptive capacity, particularly in low-lying islands and coasts, Arctic and high mountain regions with development challenges (high confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.7, Box 2.4, 3.5.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 5.5.2, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Boxes 2 and 3 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
29

Strengthening Response Options
C. The far-reaching services and options provided by ocean and cryosphere-related ecosystems can be supported by protection, restoration, precautionary ecosystem-based management of renewable resource use, and the reduction of pollution and other stressors (high confidence). Integrated water management (medium confidence) and ecosystem-based adaptation (high confidence) approaches lower climate risks locally and provide multiple societal benefits. However, ecological, financial, institutional and governance constraints for such actions exist (high confidence), and in many contexts ecosystem-based adaptation will only be effective under the lowest levels of warming (high confidence). (2.3.1, 2.3.3, 3.2.4, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.2, 5.2.2, 5.4.2, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Figure SPM.5}
	Networks of protected areas help maintain ecosystem services, including carbon uptake
and storage, and enable future ecosystem-based adaptation options by facilitating the poleward and altitudinal movements of species, populations, and ecosystems that occur in response to warming and sea level rise (medium confidence). Geographic barriers, ecosystem degradation, habitat fragmentation and barriers to regional cooperation limit the potential for such networks to support future species range shifts in marine, high mountain and polar land regions (high confidence). {2.3.3, 3.2.3, 3.3.2, 3.5.4, 5.5.2, Box 3.4}
                     Terrestrial and marine habitat restoration, and ecosystem management tools such as assisted species relocation and coral gardening, can be locally effective in enhancing ecosystem-based adaptation (high confidence). Such actions are most successful when they are community-supported, are science-based whilst also using local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge, have long-term support that includes the reduction or removal of non-climatic stressors, and under the lowest levels of warming (high confidence). For example, coral reef restoration options may be ineffective if global warming exceeds 1.5°C, because corals are already at high risk (very high confidence) at current levels of warming. {2.3.3, 4.4.2, 5.3.7, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Box 5.5, Figure SPM.3}
Strengthening precautionary approaches, such as rebuilding overexploited or depleted fisheries, and responsiveness of existing fisheries management strategies reduces negative climate change impacts on fisheries, with benefits for regional economies and livelihoods (medium confidence). Fisheries management that regularly assesses and updates measures over time, informed by assessments of future ecosystem trends, reduces risks for fisheries (medium confidence) but has limited ability to address ecosystem change. {3.2.4,3.5.2,5.4.2,5.5.2,5.5.3, Figure SPM.5}
■
	
              Restoration of vegetated coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows (coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystems), could provide climate change mitigation through increased carbon uptake and storage of around 0.5% of current global emissions annually (medium confidence). Improved protection and management can reduce carbon emissions from these ecosystems. Together, these actions also have multiple other benefits, such as providing storm protection, improving water quality, and benefiting biodiversity and fisheries (high confidence). Improving the quantification of carbon storage and greenhouse gas fluxes of these coastal ecosystems will reduce current uncertainties around measurement, reporting and verification (high confidence). {Box 4.3, 5.4, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Annex I: Glossary}
■
	
              Ocean renewable energy can support climate change mitigation, and can comprise energy extraction from offshore winds, tides, waves, thermal and salinity gradient and algal biofuels. The emerging demand for alternative energy sources is expected to generate economic opportunities for the ocean renewable energy sector (high confidence), although their potential may also be affected by climate change (low confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.1, Figure 5.23}
30

	Integrated water management approaches across multiple scales can be effective at
addressing impacts and leveraging opportunities from cryosphere changes in high mountain areas. These approaches also support water resource management through the development and optimization of multi-purpose storage and release of water from reservoirs (medium confidence), with consideration of potentially negative impacts to ecosystems and communities. Diversification of tourism activities throughout the year supports adaptation in high mountain economies (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5}
C.3 Coastal communities face challenging choices in crafting context-specific and integrated responses to sea level rise that balance costs, benefits and trade-offs of available options and that can be adjusted over time (high confidence). All types of options, including protection, accommodation, ecosystem-based adaptation, coastal advance and retreat, wherever possible, can play important roles in such integrated responses (high confidence). (4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 6.9.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.3.1	The	higher	the	sea levels rise, the more challenging is coastal protection, mainly due to economic, financial and social barriers rather than due to technical limits (high confidence). In the coming decades, reducing local drivers of exposure and vulnerability such as coastal urbanization and human-induced subsidence constitute effective responses (high confidence). Where space is limited, and the value of exposed assets is high (e.g., in cities), hard protection (e.g., dikes) is likely to be a cost-efficient response option during the 21st century taking into account the specifics of the context (high confidence), but resource-limited areas may not be able to afford such investments. Where space is available, ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce coastal risk and provide multiple other benefits such as carbon storage, improved water quality, biodiversity conservation and livelihood support (medium confidence). {4.3.2, 4.4.2, Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.3.2	Some coastal accommodation measures, such as early warning systems and flood-proofing of buildings, are often both low cost and highly cost-efficient under current sea levels (high confidence). Under projected sea level rise and increase in coastal hazards some of these measures become less effective unless combined with other measures (high confidence). All types of options, including protection, accommodation, ecosystem-based adaptation, coastal advance and planned relocation, if alternative localities are available, can play important roles in such integrated responses (high confidence). Where the community affected is small, or in the aftermath of a disaster, reducing risk by coastal planned relocations is worth considering if safe alternative localities are available. Such planned relocation can be socially, culturally, financially and politically constrained (very high confidence). {4.4.2, Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, SPM B.3}
C.3.3	Responses to sea level rise and associated risk reduction present society with profound governance challenges, resulting from the uncertainty about the magnitude and rate of future sea level rise, vexing trade-offs between societal goals (e.g., safety, conservation, economic development, intra- and inter-generational equity), limited resources, and conflicting interests and values among diverse stakeholders (high confidence). These challenges can be eased using locally appropriate combinations of decision analysis, land-use planning, public participation, diverse knowledge systems and conflict resolution approaches that are adjusted over time as circumstances change (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1,4.4.3, 4.4.4, 6.9}
C.3.4	Despite	the	large	uncertainties about the magnitude and rate of post 2050 sea level rise, many coastal decisions with time horizons of decades to over a century are being made now (e.g., critical infrastructure, coastal protection works, city planning) and can be improved by taking relative sea level rise into account, favouring flexible responses (i.e., those that can be adapted over time) supported by monitoring systems for early warning signals, periodically adjusting decisions (i.e., adaptive decision making), using robust decision-making approaches, expert judgement, scenario-building, and multiple knowledge systems (high confidence). The sea level rise range that needs to be considered for planning and implementing coastal responses depends on the risk tolerance of













































Enabling Conditions
C.4 Enabling climate resilience and sustainable development depends critically on urgent and ambitious emissions reductions coupled with coordinated sustained and increasingly ambitious adaptation actions (very high confidence). Key enablers for implementing effective responses to climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere include intensifying cooperation and coordination among governing authorities across spatial scales and planning horizons. Education and climate literacy, monitoring and forecasting, use of all available knowledge sources, sharing of data, information and knowledge, finance, addressing social vulnerability and equity, and institutional support are also essential. Such investments enable capacity-building, social learning, and participation in context-specific adaptation, as well as the negotiation of trade-offs and realisation of co-benefits in reducing short-term risks and building long-term resilience and sustainability. (high confidence). This report reflects the state of science for ocean and cryosphere for low levels of global warming (1.5°C), as also assessed in earlier IPCC and IPBES reports. {1.1, 1.5, 1.8.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4, Figure 2.7, 2.5, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4, 5.2.2, Box 5.3, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 6.4.3, 6.5.3, 6.8, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.4.1 Mfl	K4* In light of observed and projected changes in the ocean and cryosphere, many nations will face challenges to adapt, even with ambitious mitigation (very high confidence). In a high emissions scenario, many ocean- and cryosphere-dependent communities are projected to face adaptation limits (e.g. biophysical, geographical, financial, technical, social, political and institutional) during the second half of the 21st century. Low emission pathways, for comparison, limit the risks from ocean and cryosphere changes in this century and beyond and enable more effective responses (high confidence), whilst also creating co-benefits. Profound economic and institutional transformative change will enable Climate Resilient Development Pathways in the ocean and cryosphere context (high confidence). {1.1,1.4-1.7, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1-3 in Chapter 1,2.3.1, 2.4, Box 3.2, Figure 3.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3, 3.4.3, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.3.4, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.6, 5.4.2, 5.5.3, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.4.2	K4*	Intensifying	cooperation	and coordination among governing authorities across scales, jurisdictions, sectors, policy domains and planning horizons can enable effective responses to changes in the ocean, cryosphere and to sea level rise (high confidence). Regional cooperation, including treaties and conventions, can support adaptation action; however, the extent to which responding to impacts and losses arising from changes in the ocean and cryosphere is enabled through regional policy frameworks is currently limited (high confidence). Institutional arrangements that provide strong multiscale linkages with local and Indigenous communities benefit adaptation (high confidence). Coordination and complementarity between national and transboundary regional policies can support efforts to address risks to resource security and management, such as water and fisheries (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4, Box 2.4, 2.5, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9.2}

high mountains, and climate change risks in the Arctic - also reveal the enabling influence of taking a long-term perspective when making short-term decisions, explicitly accounting for uncertainty of context-specific risks beyond 2050 (high confidence), and building governance capabilities to tackle complex risks (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9, Figure SPM.5}
	Investments	in	education	and	capacity	building	at various levels and scales facilitates
social learning and long-term capability for context-specific responses to reduce risk and enhance resilience (high confidence). Specific activities include utilization of multiple knowledge systems and regional climate information into decision making, and the engagement of local communities, Indigenous peoples, and relevant stakeholders in adaptive governance arrangements and planning frameworks (medium confidence). Promotion of climate literacy and drawing on local, Indigenous and scientific knowledge systems enables public awareness, understanding and social learning about locality-specific risk and response potential (high confidence). Such investments can develop, and in many cases transform existing institutions and enable informed, interactive and adaptive governance arrangements (high confidence). {1.8.3, 2.3.2, Figure 2.7, Box 2.4, 2.4, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9}
Context-specific monitoring and forecasting of changes in the ocean and the cryosphere
informs adaptation planning and implementation, and facilitates robust decisions on trade-offs between short- and long-term gains (medium confidence). Sustained long-term monitoring, sharing of data, information and knowledge and improved context-specific forecasts, including early warning systems to predict more extreme El Niño/La Niña events, tropical cyclones, and marine heatwaves, help to manage negative impacts from ocean changes such as losses in fisheries, and adverse impacts on human health, food security, agriculture, coral reefs, aquaculture, wildfire, tourism, conservation, drought and flood (high confidence). {2.4, 2.5, 3.5.2, 4.4.4, 5.5.2, 6.3.1, 6.3.3, 6.4.3, 6.5.3, 6.9}
	Prioritising	measures	to	address	social	vulnerability	and	equity	underpins	efforts	to	promote
fair and just climate resilience and sustainable development (high confidence), and can be helped by creating safe community settings for meaningful public participation, deliberation and conflict resolution (medium confidence). {Box 2.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, Figure SPM.5}
*	This 	assessment of the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate reveals the benefits of
ambitious mitigation and effective adaptation for sustainable development and, conversely, the escalating costs and risks of delayed action. The potential to chart Climate Resilient Development Pathways varies within and among ocean, high mountain and polar land regions. Realising this potential depends on transformative change. This highlights the urgency of prioritising timely, ambitious, coordinated and enduring action (very high confidence). {1.1,1.8, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.5, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.3.4, 4.4, Table 4.9, 5.5, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}

,,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK,GEO-6,,"GEO-6 Assessment Process


The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), focusing on the theme ""healthy planet, healthy people"", aims to help policymakers and all of society achieve the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, internationally agreed environmental goals and the multilateral environmental agreements. It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analyzing current and past environmental policy, and identifying future options for achieving sustainable development by 2050.
The original request to prepare GEO-6 came from Member states at the first session of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), when, in paragraph 8 of resolution 1/4, the Executive Director of UNEP was requested, within the programme of work and budget, to undertake the preparation of the sixth Global Environment Outlook, supported by UNEP Live, with the scope, objectives and procedures of GEO-6 to be defined by a transparent global, intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation informed by document UNEP/EA.1/INF/14, resulting in a scientifically credible, peer-reviewed GEO-6 and its accompanying summary for policymakers, to be endorsed by the Environment Assembly no later than in 2018.
At its third session, the Environment Assembly, in paragraphs 1 and 2 of its decision 3/1, requested the Executive Directorio issue the sixth Global Environment Outlook at least three months before the fourth session of the Assembly; to schedule the negotiations on the Summary for policymakers at least six weeks in advance of the fourth session of the Assembly; and to present the Outlook and the Summary for consideration and possible endorsement by the Assembly at its fourth session.

Scope
GEO-6 builds on previous GEO reports and continues to provide an analysis of the state of the global environment, the global, regional and national policy response as well as the outlook for the foreseeable future. It differs from previous GEO reports in its emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals and in providing possible means of accelerating achievement of these goals. GEO- 6 is made up of four distinct but closely linked parts.
❖ Part A assesses the state of the global environment in relation to key internationally agreed goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals.
❖ Part B provides an analysis of the effectiveness of the policy response to these environmental challenges.
❖ Part C reviews the scenarios literature and assesses pathways towards achieving Agenda 2030 as well as achieving a truly sustainable world in 2050.
❖ Part D identifies future data and knowledge necessary to improve our ability to assess environmental impacts.
The GEO-6 also considers key policy questions. These include:
❖ What are the primary drivers of environmental change?
❖ 
What is the current state of the environment and why?
❖ How successful have we been in achieving our internationally agreed environmental goals?
❖ Have there been successful environmental policies?
❖ What are the policy lessons learned and possible solutions?
❖ Is the current policy response enough?
❖ What are the business as usual scenarios and what does a sustainable future look like?
❖ What are the emerging issues and megatrends including their possible impacts?
❖ What are the possible pathways to achieving Agenda 2030 and other internationally agreed environmental goals?
The development of GEO-6 involved extensive collaboration both within UN Environment and between UN Environment and a network of multidisciplinary experts and research institutions.
The intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation mentioned above (Oct. 2014) requested that experts for content development, including reviewers and advisory groups, be nominated by governments and other main stakeholders based on their expertise and using a transparent nomination process while considering geographic and gender balance.
The following three GEO-6 specialized advisory bodies were convened to support the assessment process:
High-Level Intergovernmental and Stakeholder Advisory Group
The panel included 25-30 high-level government representatives from all six UN Environment regions as well as 8-10 key stakeholders. The High-level Group provided strategic advice and initial guidance on the structure and content of the GEO-6 Summary for Policymakers and further guidance to the experts in finalizing the draft Summary, in preparation for the final intergovernmental negotiation.
Science Advisory Panel
The Panel included 22 distinguished scientists who met face to- face five times. The Panel was responsible for providing advice on the scientific credibility of the assessment process. The Panel provided scientific advice; standards and guidelines for the assessment and review process; and reviewed the findings of the mid-term evaluation of the assessment process.
Assessment Methodologies, Data and Information Working Group
This working group of 12 professionals met face-to-face three times between 2015 and 2018 and provided support and guidance to the assessment process on the use of core datasets and indicators.
This Summary for Policymakers is based on and consistent with the findings of the GEO-6 assessment. The GEO-6 Summary for Policymakers was negotiated and endorsed at an intergovernmental meeting from 21 to 24 January 2019 in Nairobi, Kenya.


Summary for Policymakers: Sixth Global Environment Outlook


1. What is the Global Environment Outlook?



The Global Environment Outlook (GEO) is the result of a consultative and participatory process to prepare an independent assessment of the state of the environment, the effectiveness of the policy response in addressing environmental challenges and the possible pathways to achieving various internationally agreed environmental goals. The GEO is a series of studies that inform environmental decision-making for Governments and other stakeholders. {1.1}
The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), under the theme ""Healthy Planet, Healthy People"", aims to provide a sound, evidence-based source of environmental information to help policymakers and all of society to achieve the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and internationally agreed environmental goals, and to implement the multilateral environmental agreements. It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analysing current and past environmental policies and identifying future options to achieve sustainable development by 2050. {1.1}
Since the first edition of the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) in 1997, there have been many examples of environmental improvement, especially where problems have been well- identified, manageable, and where regulatory and technological solutions have been readily available. Much more can be achieved in that regard through more effective implementation of existing policies. {Chapters 12 to 17}
Nevertheless, the overall condition of the global environment has continued to deteriorate since the first edition of GEO, despite environmental policy efforts across all countries and regions. Environmental policy efforts are being hindered by a variety of factors, in particular unsustainable production and consumption- patterns in most countries and climate change. GEO-6 concludes that unsustainable human activities globally have degraded the Earth's ecosystems, endangering the ecological foundations of society. {Chapters 4 to 9}
Urgent action at an unprecedented scale is necessary to arrest and reverse this situation, thereby protecting human and environmental health and maintaining the current and future integrity of global ecosystems. Key actions include reducing land degradation, biodiversity loss, and air, land and water pollution; improving water management and resource management; climate change mitigation and adaptation; resource efficiency; addressing decarbonization, decoupling and detoxification; and the prevention and management of risk and disasters. Those all require more ambitious and effective policies, including sustainable consumption and production, greater resource efficiency and improved resource management, integrated ecosystem management, and integrated waste management and prevention.1 2 3 4 {Chapter 22}

Mainstreaming environmental considerations into social and economic decisions at all levels is of vital importance. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, GEO-6 shows that environmental issues are best addressed in conjunction with related economic and social issues, taking into account synergies and trade-offs between different goals and targets, including consideration of eguity and gender dimensions. Governance can be improved at the local, national, regional and global levels, including broad coordination between policy areas. More ambitious and effectively implemented environmental policies are necessary, but alone they are not sufficient to meet sustainable development objectives. At the same time as ensuring sustainable sources of financing for sustainable development and aligning financing flows with environmental priorities, capacities have to be strengthened and scientific information taken into account for environmental management. Strong commitment from all stakeholders, partnerships and international cooperation would greatly facilitate the realization of environmental goals.
{Chapters 22, 23, 24}
GEO-6 shows that a healthy environment is the best foundation for economic prosperity, human health and well-being. As figure SPM.1 illustrates, human behaviour has had various impacts on biodiversity, atmosphere, oceans, water and land.
That environmental degradation, which ranges from serious to irreversible, has had a negative impact on human health. Atmospheric pollution has had the most severe negative impact, followed by degradation of water, biodiversity, ocean and land environment. It is therefore important that opportunities for prosperity and well-being that maintain or regain the integrity of ecosystems should be attained through sustainable development pathways that are shared and pursued globally. {24.4}
The following sections highlight the main global drivers of environmental change, the condition of the environment, the scale and effectiveness of policy responses, the potential pathways for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in an increasingly complex world, and the data and information needs and opportunities that can support decision-making towards achieving those Goals.
NOTE: Dotted arrows show how things may be experienced differently in various parts of the world
Source: Gupta et al. (2019).
Note: The figure shows the degree of impact of human activity on the health of the planet (ranging from good health to irreversible damage) and the impact of the health of the planet on human health (ranging from low damage to high damage). Some environmental and health impact may be remediable in the short or long term, but ""irreversible"" environmental impact can only be remedied over the very long term, if at all.

2. What is happening to our environment and how have we responded?



2.1 Drivers of environmental change, megatrends and governance challenges
Human population dynamics or trends, particularly population pressure, and economic development have been acknowledged for many decades as the primary drivers of environmental change (well established). More recently, rapid urbanization and accelerating technological innovation have been additional influences. There are wide disparities globally in the consumption and production patterns that lie behind those drivers. {2.1.1,2.2}
Those driving forces are also strongly intertwined, complex, and spread widely and unevenly across the world (well established). They are megatrends, developing at speeds with which responses by established governance structures at all levels - urban and rural, local, national, regional, global and supranational - are thus far insufficient to keep pace. {2.1.1}
The global population in 2018 is some 7.5 billion, with median projections estimating nearly 10 billion by 2050 and nearly 11 billion by 2100 (United Nations figures) (well established). Increases in life expectancy and reductions in infant and other mortality mean that population growth rates will continue to remain positive in all regions except Europe and certain parts of Asia. Unequal access to education, and lack of empowerment of women, as well as their lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services, all contribute to high birth rates. Without changes in production and consumption patterns, population growth will continue to increase environmental pressures. {2.3, 2.3.4, 2.1.1}
Urbanization is happening at an unprecedented rate globally and cities have become the foremost drivers of economic development across the world (well established). More people, especially in emerging and developing economies, are living in cities and towns, and the world's urban population is expected to rise to 66 per cent by 2050 (well established). Approximately 90 per cent of city growth will occur in Africa and Asia. Africa is the most rapidly urbanizing region, and is also the region expected to experience the highest population growth (well established). Some 30 per cent of urban residents globally have no access to basic services or social protection, with poor women in low-income urban neighbourhoods being particularly vulnerable. {2.4, 2.4.3}
Almost all coastal cities of any size and small island developing States are increasingly vulnerable to rising sea-levels, floods and storm surges caused by climate change and extreme weather events (established but incomplete). In general, those cities in developing countries that are urbanizing most rapidly are in a more vulnerable situation. In contrast, sustainable urbanization can represent an opportunity to increase citizens' well-being while decreasing their environmental impact. Lower- impact urban lifestyles can be facilitated by improved governance, infrastructure, services, sustainable land-use planning and technological opportunities. Investment in rural areas can reduce pressure to migrate. {2.4.4,17.3}

Economic development has lifted billions of people out of poverty and enhanced access to health and education in most regions of the world (well established). Nevertheless, the ""Grow now, clean up later"" economic approach used in certain regions has not accounted for climate change, pollution or degraded natural systems. That approach has also contributed to increasing inequality within and between countries and will ultimately be more costly. It will not be able to sustainably support 10 billion healthy, fulfilled and productive people in 2050 without profound and urgent changes in consumption and production patterns. {2.5.1}
Decoupling of environmental degradation and resource use from economic growth and associated production and consumption patterns is required for achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (well established). Partial decoupling between environmental pressures and economic growth can already be observed for some impacts and resources in certain countries. Further decoupling reguires the scaling-up of existing sustainable practices and more fundamental transitions in the ways in which we produce, consume and dispose of goods and materials across society. Those transitions are likely to be more effective if supported by long-term, comprehensive, science- based targets that provide the objective basis for future directions and actions. {2.5.1}
The growth in technological innovation since the 1990s has been unprecedented, both globally and historically, bringing many benefits to people's lives, but has also had some negative consequences (established but incomplete). Some technological and social innovations can reduce the environmental pressures associated with unsustainable consumption and production. Enhancing access to existing environmental technologies that are adapted to domestic circumstances could help countries to achieve environmental objectives more quickly. Application of precautionary approaches, according to international agreements (where applicable), to new technological innovations can reduce unintended negative consequences for human and ecosystem health. {2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4}
Countries that prioritize low-carbon, resource-efficient practices may gain a competitive advantage in the global economy (established but incomplete). Well-designed environmental policies and appropriate technologies and products can often be implemented in tandem at limited or no cost to growth and competitiveness and can expand the capacity of countries to develop and diffuse innovative technologies. That may be positive for employment and development, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, facilitating sustainable development (established but incomplete). {2.5.1}
Climate change is a priority issue affecting both human systems, including human health, and natural systems - air, biological diversity, freshwater, oceans and land - and which alters the complex interactions between those systems (well established). Historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions have committed the world to an extended period of climate change (well established), which is leading to global warming of air and ocean; rising sea-levels; melting glaciers, permafrost and Arctic sea ice; changes in carbon, biogeochemical and global water cycles; food security crises; fresh water scarcity; and more frequent and extreme weather events. Higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide also lead to ocean acidification and affect the composition, structure and functionality of ecosystems. Time is running out to prevent irreversible and dangerous impacts of climate change. Unless greenhouse gas emissions are radically reduced, the world is on course to exceed the temperature threshold set out in the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That makes climate change a global driver of environmental, social, health and economic impact and heightened society-wide risks. {2.7.3}
Society-wide risks associated with environmental degradation and climate change effects are generally more profound for people in a disadvantaged situation, particularly women and children in developing countries (established but incomplete). Many of the impacts outlined above are serious or irreversible and may lead to loss of livelihood, increased morbidity and mortality, and economic slowdown, and have greater potential for violent conflict, human mass migration and decreasing social resilience. Measures for more effective adaptation are now urgently required, especially for populations and regions which are in a vulnerable situation. {2.7.3}
The increasing scale, global reach and speed of change in those drivers of environmental change pose urgent challenges for managing environmental and climate change problems
(well established). In many domains, our scientific understanding of adverse, increasingly high impact is becoming more widespread, as is the understanding that the nature of change may sometimes be irreversible. The thematic priorities addressed by GEO-6 have been chosen and analysed with that context in mind and the summaries by theme have been organized to provide decision-makers with the most crucial insights within themes, including links to drivers and optional avenues for action. {2.7.3}

2.2 The state of the environment
2.2.1 Air

Emissions generated by human activity continue to alter the composition of the atmosphere, leading to air pollution, climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion and exposure to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (well established). {5.3}
Air pollution is the main environmental contributor to the global burden of disease, leading to between 6 million and 7 million premature deaths (well established) and welfare losses estimated at US$5 trillion annually (established but incomplete). Air pollution exposure, especially to fine particulate matter, is highest for urban residents in some countries with rapid urbanization trends (established but incomplete) and for the approximately 3 billion people who depend on burning fuels such as wood, coal, crop residue, dung and kerosene for cooking, heating and lighting (well established). The elderly, very young, ill and poor are more susceptible to the impact of air pollution (well established).
{5.2.4, 5.4.1}
Globally, decreasing emission trends from local air pollutants in certain sectors and regions have been offset by larger increases in others, including some rapidly developing countries and areas of rapid urbanization (well established). Available data indicate that emissions decrease significantly when regulations are put in place. {5.2} International agreements have been successful in addressing specific chemicals. Both improvement of energy efficiency and pollution control techniques may be used to achieve lower air pollutant emissions. As controls have been placed on power plants, large industrial facilities and vehicles, the relative contribution of other sources, including agriculture, domestic fuel use, construction and other portable equipment, and forest or open fires, has grown in importance (established). Electricity generated from non-renewable resources and the fossil fuel production and consumption sectors (""energy"") is the largest anthropogenic emitting sector of S02 and non-methane volatile organic compounds and the main emitting sector of other air pollutants, including greenhouse gases.
Global increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts have occurred, even while mitigation activities have taken place in many parts of the world. Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in C02 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Atmospheric concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases continue to increase, driven primarily by fossil fuel extraction and use for electricity generation, industry and transport, although they are also affected by land use, land-use change, agriculture and forestry (well established). The evidence of current global climate change is unequivocal (well established). Since 1880, the global average surface temperature has increased by between approximately 0.8 degrees Celsius and 1.2 degrees Celsius (very likely). Eight of the ten warmest years on record have occurred within the past decade (virtually certain). If greenhouse gas emissions persist, global average temperatures will continue to increase at the current rate, crossing the temperature target agreed as part of the Paris Agreement between 2030 and 2052 (very likely). The Paris Agreement committed countries to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that doing so would significantly reduce the risks and impact of climate change. Current nationally determined contributions, presented in Paris in 2015, constitute only one third of the mitigation required to establish a least- cost pathway for staying well below 2 degrees Celsius (well established). {2.2, 2.7, 4.2.1, 5.2, 5.3.4} To maintain a good chance of remaining well below a 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase, emissions need to drop by between 40 and 70 per cent globally between 2010 and 2050, falling to net zero by 2070.
{2.7.4}
Achieving the goals set out in the Paris Agreement requires transformational changes leading to deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the balancing of emission sources and sinks (established but incomplete). In addition to emissions reductions for C02 the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (also called forcers), specifically black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons, provide opportunities to limit warming in the short term and are a critical component of an integrated climate change mitigation and air-quality management programme. However, since long-lived greenhouse gases dominate climate forcing in the long term, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants in the short term needs to be combined with mitigation of long-term greenhouse gases.
(well established). {4.2.1, 5.3.4} Non-C02 emissions in pathways that limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius show deep reductions that are similar to those in pathways limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius.
Government capacity and political will to manage air pollution and climate change varies significantly (well established).
Some regions have well-developed systems of national-to-local policies and compliance and enforcement programmes (well established), although ambition levels in terms of both scope and policy may differ. In other regions, international agreements or national legislation may exist, but implementation and compliance and enforcement are often affected by weak national-to-local institutional capacity (established but incomplete). Future policy efforts can build upon renewed attention to those issues in international forums and several decades of experience with various governance strategies in different countries. Between 1998 and 2010, there was a five-fold increase in the number of national climate laws (more than 1,500 laws and policies worldwide) and by 2012 those laws covered 67 per cent of all emissions (well established). Some city and subnational governments are leading the way with benefits for other parts of their countries (well established). {5.4, 5.5,12}

2.2.2 Biodiversity
A major species extinction event, compromising planetary integrity and Earth's capacity to meet human needs, is unfolding. Biodiversity refers to the diversity of living things at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels. It helps to regulate climate, filters air and water, enables soil formation and mitigates the impact of natural disasters. It also provides timber, fish, crops, pollination, ecotourism, medicines, and physical and mental health benefits (well established). {6.1,6.4.2}

Environmental and human health are intricately intertwined, and many emerging infectious diseases are driven by activities that affect biodiversity (established but incomplete). Changes to the landscape (through natural resource extraction and use, for example) can facilitate disease emergence in wildlife, domestic animals, plants and people. Zoonoses are estimated to account for more than 60 per cent of human infectious diseases. {6.1, 13.1; boxes 6.1,13.1}
Genetic diversity is declining, threatening food security and the resilience of ecosystems, including agricultural systems and food security (well established). {6.5.1}
Populations of species are declining and species extinction rates are increasing. At present, 42 per cent of terrestrial invertebrates, 34 per cent of freshwater invertebrates and 25 per cent of marine invertebrates are considered at risk of extinction. Between 1970 and 2014, global vertebrate species population abundances declined by on average 60 per cent (well established). Steep declines in pollinator abundance have also been documented. {6.5.2}
Ecosystem integrity and functions are declining. Ten out of every fourteen terrestrial habitats have seen a decrease in vegetation productivity and just under half of all terrestrial ecoregions are classified as having an unfavourable status (well established). {6.5.3}
Native and non-native invasive species threaten ecosystems, habitats and other species. The economic costs, both direct and indirect, amount to many billions of dollars annually. {6.4.2}



Biodiversity loss is also an equity issue, disproportionately affecting poorer people, women and children. If current rates of decline continue, future generations will be deprived of the health benefits of biodiversity. The livelihoods of 70 per cent of people living in poverty directly depend on natural resources (well established). {6.1,6.6.5; boxes 6.5,13.2}
The critical pressures on biodiversity are habitat change, loss and degradation; unsustainable agricultural practices; the spread of invasive species; pollution, including microplastics; and overexploitation, including illegal logging and trade in wildlife. Illegal trade in wildlife, fisheries and forest products is worth between US$90 billion and US$270 billion per annum. There is evidence to suggest that climate change will pose the gravest threat in the future, as species, including disease vectors, migrate with temperature shifts (well established). {6.5}
Although governance efforts are progressing, greater efforts are required to achieve international objectives, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets within the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 -2020, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Over 190 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans have been submitted to the Convention, although their guality and reliability, as well their subseguent implementation, remains uneven; the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols to the Convention provide a deeper governance context. There is increasing international collaboration between various law enforcement authorities in combatting illegal wildlife trafficking. {Annex 6-1}
The science-policy interface for biodiversity and the contribution that nature makes to people was strengthened in 2012 through the establishment of the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity are negotiating the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Negotiations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea continue towards an agreement on the sustainable use and conservation of marine biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction. {6.7.2, 6.7.4,13.1}
Several multilateral environmental agreements provide additional governance architecture on biodiversity, including the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The continual updating of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and other independent monitoring efforts, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the consideration of the multiple values of biodiversity and the inclusion of the value of biodiversity in national economic valuation methods, will support and inform the implementation thereof. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to expand ecosystem assessments to better understand the global state of ecosystems and the trends therein. {6.5.3, 6.7.4, annexes 6.1 and 13.1}
Protecting species and ecosystems requires conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources (well established). Species and ecosystems are most effectively safeguarded through the conservation of natural habitats (well established) and there is clear evidence that conservation can help to reduce biodiversity loss. Implementation, management and representative coverage of different ecosystems within protected areas remains insufficient. Less than 15 per cent of terrestrial habitats, including inland waters, and less than 16 per cent of coastal and marine areas within national jurisdiction are protected areas. {6.7.3}
Biodiversity is slowly being mainstreamed or integrated into health, gender and other equity concerns through such efforts as the 2015-2020 Gender Plan of Action under the Convention on Biological Diversity and its relationship to the Convention's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 -2020 and the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (well established). Indigenous peoples and local communities play a key role in biodiversity protection by offering bottom-up, self-driven and innovative solutions, based on traditional knowledge and the ecosystem approach. However, protected areas can adversely affect indigenous communities if access to natural resources within protected areas is denied. {13.1}
Ex situ conservation of genetic material provides safeguards for maintaining adaptive potential, in particular of crop and agricultural species. Gene banks and seed collections complement in situ conservation of genetic resources, yet the conservation status of genetic diversity for most wild species remains poorly documented. Yet accelerating biodiversity loss and the large, escalating costs of inaction, including numerous threats to human health, reguire an urgent increase in global investment in sustainable use and conservation, and the consistent integration of biodiversity concerns into all facets of economic and social development. {6.5.1,13.2.4}
Greater focus on strengthening governance systems; improving policy frameworks through research; policy integration; implementation; and encouraging partnerships and participation, are all measures that have the potential to address the greatest pressures on biodiversity. Efforts to combat biodiversity loss must also address poverty eradication, food security challenges, gender inequality, systemic inefficiencies and corruption in governance structures and other social variables. Identification of the countries of origin of genetic resources, in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol thereto, will help to ensure progress against the objectives of those instruments and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the commercial utilization of those resources with such countries. {6.8}

2.2.3 Oceans and coasts
The principal drivers of change facing oceans and coasts are ocean warming and acidification, ocean pollution and the increasing use of oceans, coasts, deltas and basins for food production, transportation, settlement, recreation, resource extraction and energy production (well established). The main impacts of those drivers are marine ecosystem degradation and loss, including death of coral reefs (well established), reduced marine living resources and the resulting disturbance of marine and coastal ecosystem food chains (well established), increased nutrient and sediment run-off (well established) and marine litter (established but incomplete). Those impacts interact in ways that are just beginning to be understood and their interaction may amplify their effect (Inconclusive). If left unaddressed, there is a major risk that they will combine to produce a destructive cycle of degradation and that the ocean will no longer provide many vital ecosystem services (for example, livelihoods, income, health, employment, and aesthetic, cultural and religious values).

What is happening to our environment and how have we responded?

More effective compliance, enforcement and other instruments are needed, as current efforts are not sufficient to achieve the aims of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 14. Interventions based on emerging technologies, taking into account a precautionary approach, in accordance with international agreements (where applicable), and strategic management approaches, such as resilience-based management and ecosystem-based management, can contribute to improved conservation of marine ecosystems and marine living resources. {7.1,14,14.2.1,14.2.3,14.2.4}
A holistic, integrated monitoring and assessment of the marine environment needs to be fostered hand in hand with the implementation of pollution reduction measures to achieve and maintain the targets of ""Good Environmental Status11 of the marine environment, including harmonization of assessment criteria and methods at all levels. To be effective, such measures should be combined with actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change and reduce the input of pollution and litter to the oceans while promoting their conservation and sustainable use. {7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3}
The rate of human-induced release of greenhouse gases is driving rising sea levels, changes in ocean temperatures and ocean acidification. Coral reefs are being devastated by those changes (well established). Mass coral bleaching, induced by chronic heat, has damaged many tropical reefs beyond recovery (well established). The collective value of coral reefs has been estimated at US$29 billion per annum. The loss of coral reefs has an impact on fisheries, tourism, community health, livelihoods and marine habitats (well established). Interventions based on emerging technologies and sustainable management approaches (such as resilience-based management, integrated coastal zone management and ecosystem-based management) are key to building resilience and may help to preserve some areas of reef (unresolved), but Governments should prepare for a dramatic decline (if not a collapse) (well established) of coral reef-based industries and ecosystem services, as well as negative effects on food chains related to the decline and collapse of coral reefs. {7.3.1,14.2.1}
The oceans play an important role in the global economy and are likely to become increasingly important. Fisheries and aquaculture currently generate US$252 billion annually. Small-scale fisheries support the livelihoods of between 58 million and 120 million people (established but Incomplete). Fish provide 3.1 billion people with over 20 per cent of their dietary protein and contain nutrients important for their health. Ensuring the sustainability of capture fisheries and aquaculture requires significant investment in monitoring, assessment and operations management and, in many cases, strong local community- based approaches. Investment in fisheries monitoring and gear technologies can improve selectivity of target species when harvesting and reduce habitat impact, both in ocean fisheries and aquaculture. {14.2.4}
Measures to minimize the effects of fishing on the ecosystem have had mixed success (established but incomplete). Where resource assessments and monitoring, control, and surveillance and enforcement measures are not available, overfishing and illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing continues and may be expanding (established but incomplete). {14.2.3,14.4,14.5}
Marine litter, including plastics and microplastics, is now found in all oceans, at all depths (established but incomplete). The scale and importance of the problem has received increasing attention in recent years, but there are still large gaps in knowledge. Current estimates suggest that input of plastic marine litter linked to domestic waste mismanagement in coastal areas amounts to some 8 million tonnes annually, (established but incomplete) 80 per cent of which originates from land-based sources. Marine plastic litter can result in a significant ecological impact from entanglement and ingestion, and can also act as a vector for the transport of invasive species and other pollutants (established but Incomplete). Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) is a major source of marine litter. Not only is ALDFG highly harmful, it also reduces numbers offish stock and constitutes a significant economic threat, given its ability to damage maritime vessels, fisheries and ecosystem services. {7.3.3, 7.4.3}
The growing presence and abundance of microplastics has potential adverse effects on the health of both marine organisms (established but Incomplete) and humans (unresolved). Furthermore, marine litter has a significant economic impact on a range of coastal sectors, such as tourism and recreation, shipping and yachting, fisheries, aquaculture, agriculture and human health (established but incomplete). The damage to fishing gear in Europe alone is estimated at more than US$72 million per annum and the cost of cleaning beaches is estimated at US$735 million per annum, a figure which is increasing (established but incomplete). {7.4.4}
Improving waste management, including recycling and end- of-life management, is the most urgent short-term solution to reducing input of litter to the ocean (well established). Longer-term solutions include improved governance at all levels, and behavioural and systemic changes that reduce plastic pollution from the production and use of plastic, and increase recycling and reuse.
A holistic and evidence-based approach, taking into account the full life-cycle approach to waste management should be applied. Cleaning up coasts and beaches can provide environmental, social and economic benefits, and trapping surface litter in the ocean may be effective in small areas, but such efforts should not distract from action to stop litter entering the ocean. While many relevant international agreements exist, there is no global agreement that addresses the issue of marine litter and microplastics in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Coordination and cooperation between international bodies could be enhanced to progress international agreement. {14.2.2}
Policy-sensitive indicators used to track progress in addressing key pressures and drivers may not fully capture the multiple dimensions of pressures and drivers (well established). Area- based indicators, such as Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 on the coverage of marine protected areas under national jurisdiction, do not alone establish that such areas are effectively managed; nor can they guard against the impact of climate change or pollution (well established). Efforts to develop methods to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas and their contribution to overall ocean health are therefore critical. The lack of standardization and compatibility between the methods used and the results obtained in various bottom-up projects makes an overall assessment of the status of marine litter across large geographic areas difficult (well established). {14.3,14.3.1,14.3.2,14.3.3}
2.2.4 
Land and soil
Food production is the largest anthropogenic use of land, using 50 per cent of habitable land (well established). Livestock production uses 77 per cent of agricultural land for feed production, pasture and grazing (well established) (see figure SPM.4). Furthermore, traditional livestock provides livelihoods for many indigenous and local communities. Sustainable land management can address food security while preventing the loss of the contribution made by nature and promoting gender and social equality (established but incomplete). Adequately feeding 10 billion people by 2050 will require an increase of 50 per cent in food production (well established), while some 33 per cent of global edible food is lost or wasted, of which approximately 56 per cent occurs in developed countries (well established). Increasing productivity has slowed down the expansion of agricultural land, but inefficient or unsustainable farming systems are often associated with environmental and soil degradation and biodiversity loss (unresolved), and an increase in crop specialization and distribution can raise the risk of poor harvests. {8.5.1, 8.5.3, 8.4.1}
Securing land rights for local communities can help to turn land assets into development opportunities and secure more sustainable use of land. For most people, land is their most important asset (well established). Women represent 43 per cent of those active in agriculture, yet they hold the title to less than 20 per cent of agricultural land. Insecure access to land resources hinders sustainable land management (well established). Indigenous and other forms of community-managed land could generate billions of US dollars' worth of ecosystem benefits through, among other things, carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and erosion control (established but incomplete). Those benefits could justify securing land tenure and the right to inheritance for women and indigenous and local communities. Decreasing the gender gap in access to information and technology, and access to and control over production inputs and land, could increase agricultural productivity and reduce hunger and poverty (established but incomplete). Policies
empowering women, indigenous peoples, family farmers and pastoralists to ensure that those groups have secure access to land resources, fertilizers and other inputs, knowledge, extension services, financial services, markets, opportunities for adding value and non-farm employment can facilitate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and reduce environmental impact (established but incomplete), increase agricultural productivity and contribute to reducing poverty and hunger (well established). {8.6, 8.5.3}
Land degradation and desertification have increased (established but incomplete), with land degradation hotspots covering approximately 29 per cent of global land, where some
3.2 billion people reside (well established). Investing in avoiding land degradation and restoring degraded land makes sound economic sense and the benefits generally far exceed the costs. {8.4.2}
Whilst the pace of deforestation has slowed, it continues globally. Furthermore, although many countries are now taking steps to increase their forest cover, it is primarily being done through plantations and reforestation (well established), which may not provide the same range of ecosystem services as natural forests. {8.4.1}
Urban clusters - meaning urban centres and their suburbs - have grown by a factor of approximately 2.5 since 1975 (well established), and in 2015 accounted for 7.6 per cent of global land, affecting, among other things, the hydrological cycle and soil functions, causing urban heat islands. {8.4.1}
Achieving the land-related Sustainable Development Goals requires adequate land and water resource management
(well established). Innovative technologies, sustainable land management strategies, nature-based solutions and land- resource stewardship (such as sustainable forest management, agro-silvo-pastoral production systems, conservation agriculture, integrated crop production and agroforestry) can contribute to making agriculture sustainable. Payment for ecosystem services, land restoration and land titling need to be more effectively promoted and adopted. When compatible with local culture, such strategies contribute to better management and conservation of land resources (well established) and are integral for the reduction of hunger (Sustainable Development Goal 2). Economic incentives for agriculture, including distortive agricultural production subsidies, contribute to land degradation, and their reduction and removal will be important for the achievement of sustainable agriculture.
{8.5.1}
Sustainable land-use planning and management can protect high-quality, fertile agricultural soil from competing interests, thus maintaining land-based ecosystem services such as food production, and preventing land from flooding and disaster. Frameworks targeting land degradation, such as the Land Degradation Neutrality initiative under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, may also contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience (well established). Yet the policy framework on land management remains complex and incomplete. {8.4.1,8.5.3, 8.5.4}
2.2.5 
Fresh water
Population growth, urbanization, water pollution and unsustainable development are all increasing pressure on water resources across the world, and that pressure is further exacerbated by climate change. In most regions, slow-onset disasters, such as water scarcity, drought and famine, lead to increased migration (well established). Increasing numbers of people are also being affected by severe storms and floods. Increasing glacial and snowpack melt as a result of global warming will affect regional and seasonal water availability, especially in Asian and Latin American rivers, which provide water for some 20 per cent of the global population (well established). Changes to the global water cycle, including extreme events, are contributing to water quantity and quality problems, with impact distributed unequally across the world. {9.1,9.1.2, 9.2}
In most regions, water quality has worsened significantly since 1990, owing to organic and chemical pollution, such as pathogens, nutrients, pesticides, sediments, heavy metals, plastic and microplastic waste, persistent organic pollutants and salinity. Some 2.3 billion people (approximately 1 in 3 of the global population) still lack access to safe sanitation (likely). Approximately 1.4 million people die annually from preventable diseases, such as diarrhoea and intestinal parasites, that are associated with pathogen-polluted drinking water and inadequate sanitation (well-established). {9.5, 9.5.7, 9.5.2}
Without effective counter-measures, human illnesses due to antimicrobial-resistant infections may become a major cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide by 2050 (established but Incomplete). Water plays a key role in this, as antimicrobial- resistant bacteria are now found in sources of treated drinking water worldwide (well-established), stemming from antibiotics entering the water cycle through domestic sewage and industrial wastewater disposal, agriculture, intensive livestock rearing and aquaculture. In addition, various endocrine-disrupting chemicals are now widely distributed through the freshwater system on all continents (well established), with long-term impact on foetal underdevelopment and male infertility (established but incomplete). {9.5.1, 9.5.7}
On the positive side, 1.5 billion people gained access to basic drinking water services over the 15-year period from 2000 to 2015. However, women and girls still carry most of the physical burden of transporting water in many developing countries, reducing the time available for them to participate in productive activities and education. The positive impact of women being able to spend time on other activities should be widely acknowledged, since economic surveys indicate that they typically reinvest up to 90 per cent of their income in their families, improving family health and nutrition, and increasing access to schooling for their children. {9.7.1}
Worldwide, agriculture uses an average of 70 per cent of all fresh water withdrawals, rising to 90 per cent in many poorer countries. The competition for more water from cities and industry creates an imperative to improve the efficiency of agricultural water use while at the same time producing more food and using fewer and less harmful inputs (well established).


Many aquifers are depleting rapidly due to overabstraction for irrigation, drinking water, industrial and mining uses (established but incomplete). More sustainable management and better monitoring of surface and groundwater is urgently needed.
{9.4.2, 9.9.5}
Promoting water-use efficiency water recycling, rainwater harvesting and desalination is becoming increasingly important to ensure greater water security and more equitable water allocation for different users and uses. The agricultural sector needs substantial improvements in water-use efficiency and productivity. The industrial and mining sectors also have strong potential for increasing water-use efficiency, recycling and reuse, as well as for limiting water pollution. Broader adoption of water- sensitive urban design, including infrastructure to manage storm water, grey water, wastewater and managed aquifer recharge, would improve water management and urban water outcomes. {9.9, 9.9.3, 9.9.5}
Freshwater ecosystems are among the world's most biodiverse habitats and valuable natural infrastructures. Wetlands buffer against impact from climate change (both drought and floods) and improve water quality, but 40 per cent of all wetlands have been lost since 1970 through agricultural development, urbanization, infrastructure development and overexploitation of water resources. Severe consequences include the loss of inland fisheries, which affects the livelihoods of millions of people (likely). The total annual economic cost of wetland losses over the 15-year period from 1996 to 2011 has been estimated at US$2.7 trillion (likely). Greater investment, both public and private, would facilitate more sustainable wetland management and restoration. {9.6}
The decomposition, due to human intervention, of peatlands, a type of wetland that stores more carbon than all the world's forests combined, currently contributes approximately 5 per cent of annual global carbon emissions (established but incomplete). The thawing permafrost in boreal peatlands, agricultural conversion of some tropical peatlands and the transformation and loss of other peatlands are causing increased carbon emissions, infrastructure damage and wildfires. Protection and restoration of peatlands, including rewetting of drained peatlands, is an important climate change mitigation strategy. {9.6.2}
Innovative and integrated policy mixes are essential to manage interactions between water, food, energy, transport, climate change, human health and ecosystems. Good governance includes integrated water resource management, as illustrated by integrated flood risk management (established but incomplete), ecosystem-based approaches in subnational and transboundary basins (well established), circular economy and other approaches that promote sustainable consumption and production as one approach towards achieving sustainable development (established but incomplete) and substantive progress on decoupling water use from economic growth through increasing water efficiency (established but incomplete). Such approaches support improved land-use planning and cross- sectoral policy coordination between government departments (well established). {9.8, 9.9.4}
Social equity and gender equality remain key aspects for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 on fresh water (well established). Enhanced participatory processes will enable greater knowledge input from local and indigenous communities into decision-making (well established). Goal 6 can only be achieved by engaging the public, private and non-governmental sectors, civil society and local actors, and by taking into account other interlinked Sustainable Development Goals. {20.3, 9.10,16.4}
Multilateral environmental agreements governing water resources and water-related ecosystem management and climate change can support the embedding of integrated water resource management in the rule of law through national and local legislation. Increased investment in the scope and rigour of standardized water data is essential to improve policy and governance for sound water management. {9.10}

2.2.6 Cross-cutting issues
Several issues cut across all environmental themes. Some, such as human health, gender, urbanization and education, relate to people and livelihoods; others, such as climate change, polar regions, mountains and environmental disasters, are concerned with changing environments; and yet others, such as the use of resources, solid waste disposal, energy, chemicals and the food system, reflect the use of resources and materials. Those topics all have Interdependent dynamics across environmental themes.
People and livelihoods
Environmental and social conditions interact to both support and damage human health (well established). Poor environmental conditions which can be changed (""modifiable conditions"") cause approximately 25 per cent of global disease and mortality (established but incomplete). In 2015, environmental pollution caused some 9 million deaths (established but incomplete), In particular from outdoor and household air pollution, but also from contaminated water (well established). Environmental health effects take a particular toll on vulnerable or disadvantaged groups related to age (children and old people), Ill-health, poverty (within and between countries) and race (established but incomplete). The risks are systemic and solutions need to be wide- ranging, tackling not only sources of pollution, but also aiming for co-benefits (established but incomplete). Major changes may be needed, with ""Healthy Planet, Healthy People"" potentially being central to our understanding of genuine progress. {4.2.1}
The scale and magnitude of global consumption, especially in urban areas, is affecting global resource flows and planetary cycles. Cities and their surrounding areas will continue to grow in both population and size and to act as generators of economic growth (established but incomplete). The process and prospect of that urbanization represent an enormous challenge for existing subnational governance structures, but also provide an opportunity to Improve human well-being, with potentially decreasing environmental Impact per capita and per unit of production (inconclusive). Given the current pace of urbanization, seizing this opportunity for future benefits depends on planning decisions made today (well established). {4.2.5}
Gender equality has a multiplier effect in advancing sustainable development, environmental protection and social justice (well established). All aspects of the environment, Including drivers, pressures, Impacts, perceptions, policies and responses, are shaped by gender relations and mutually constituted considerations of gender norms and responsibilities, and they shape one another Bringing gender perspectives to bear on environmental policies and governance, especially by supporting participation, leadership and decision-making by women, ensures that new and different questions and viewpoints, as well as gender-disaggregated data, are Integrated Into environmental assessments (well established), and public resources are more likely to be directed towards human development priorities and Investments. Decreasing the gender gap In access to Information and technology can strengthen women's control over land and other resources. {4.2.3}
Education for sustainable development is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, promoting a more sustainable society and accommodating unavoidable environmental changes (well established). Significant progress has been made around the world In Implementing education for sustainable development In all educational sectors (well established). However, scaling It up Is essential so that It can be Included as a core element of education system structures globally (well established). Policies that eliminate economic and gender barriers will Improve access to education. Education for sustainable development can be scaled up by Informal and non-formal education, Including by the media. Community engagement and local (place-based) learning also have an Important role to play. {4.2.4}
Changing environments
Climate change alters weather patterns, which in turn has a broad and deep impact on the environment, economics and society, threatening the livelihoods, health, water, food and energy security of populations (well established). In turn, that Increases poverty (well established), migration, forced displacement and conflict (established but incomplete), with particular Impact on populations In a vulnerable situation (well established). Negative effects are expected, even If the current warming Is halted; for example, If the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius Is achieved, sea levels will still continue to rise. Those risks will be amplified under conditions of warming above the 1.5 degrees Celsius target established by the Paris Agreement (established). {4.3.1}
Increases in polar surface temperature are more than two times greater than the mean global temperature rise (well established). This amplified warming has cascading effects on other components of the polar climate system, with sea Ice In the Arctic retreating, permafrost thawing, snow cover extent decreasing, and Ice sheets, Ice shelves and mountain glaciers continuing to lose mass (well established). {4.3.2} In turn, those effects have global repercussions, such as accelerated global sea level rises and the disturbance of climate and weather patterns.
The number of people affected by both slow and sudden-onset environmental disasters is increasing due to compounding effects of multiple and interacting drivers. Those drivers Include climate change and environmental degradation, poverty and social Inequality, demographic change and settlement patterns, Increasing population density In urban areas, unplanned urbanization, unsustainable use of natural resources, weak Institutional arrangements, and policies which do not take risks fully Into account. Disasters undermine human security and well-being, resulting In loss and damage to ecosystems, property, Infrastructure, livelihoods, economies and places of cultural significance, forcing millions of people to flee their homes each year Disasters disproportionately affect some of the more vulnerable populations, Including women. {4.2.2}


Resources and materials
Consumption rates and linear activities (extract-make- use-dispose) have Increased resource exploitation beyond the recovery ability of ecological systems, with harmful consequences at all levels from the local to the global (established but incomplete). Globally, two out of every five people lack access to controlled waste disposal facilities. Inadequate and sometimes illegal practices include those related to food waste, e-waste, marine litter, waste trafficking and crime. Developed countries have policies in place to promote reduced waste and resource efficiency, while developing countries still face basic management challenges, such as uncontrolled dumping, open burning and inadequate access to services (well established). Sound policies for resource accounting and waste management in the context of broader sustainable consumption and production include a circular economy as one of the approaches to achieving sustainable development through reducing, reusing, remanufacturing and refurbishing products (■established but incomplete). {4.4.1}
Global energy consumption is expected to rise significantly during the period from 2014 to 2040 (by as much as 63 per cent, according to one estimate), much of which is attributed to expected consumption in countries that currently depend on fossil energy sources (very likely). Equity and gender Issues, such as universal access to Improved final energy services, are still a problem that Is far from being resolved. Despite the fast deployment and cost reduction of renewables and Improvements In efficiency, without further and effective, ambitious measures, energy-related greenhouse gas emissions will result In the Paris Agreement temperature targets being missed (very likely). {4.4.2}
Despite the many benefits brought to humanity, in this, the most chemical-intensive era in history, the pollution that is associated with chemicals poses a global problem, because toxic substances can spread to the most remote environments, including to receiving water systems worldwide (well established). Products In everyday use contain toxic compounds that Interfere with the health of humans, other species and the environment (well established). {4.3.3}

Multilateral environmental agreements and concerted national initiatives have made progress in addressing several of the most concerning chemicals. However, significant gaps in assessing and regulating harmful chemicals continue to exist, due, inter alia, to insufficient national legislation or enforcement to address associated risks and to missed innovation opportunities. Failure to address the risks posed by such chemicals can result in adverse impact on human health and the environment, with estimated costs amounting to hundreds of billions of US dollars (established but incomplete). Emerging Issues requiring more science-based Information, precaution, In accordance with International agreements (where applicable), and risk assessment and management Include endocrine disruption, widespread antibiotic resistance and the use of nanotechnology. Global chemical safety requires best management practice In all countries, Including the provision of access to Information and public awareness (well established). Regulations, assessment and monitoring, and Industry and consumer responsibility In Informing and substituting the use of chemicals of global concern with safer alternatives when technically and economically feasible are needed {4.3.3}.
The food system, in response to growing and changing consumer demand, is increasing pressure on local ecosystems
and the global climate (well established). Agriculture Is the largest consumer of water and, when not sustainably managed, food production Is a major driver of biodiversity loss and polluter of air, fresh water and oceans, as well as a leading source of soil degradation and greenhouse gas emissions. Changing environmental conditions and consumption patterns are both Increasing such pressures and presenting new food security challenges, reflecting malnourlshment, Including In the form of overnourishment, as well as undernourishment. Providing nourishing and sustainable food for all, as envisaged In Sustainable Development Goal 2, remains challenged by climate change, natural resource constraints, demographic trends and national capacities, and necessitates significant changes In food production, distribution, storage, processing and consumption patterns (well established). {4.4.3}
3 Effectiveness of environmental policies

Most countries have introduced environmental policies and established a governance structure for such policies, and there are now hundreds of multilateral environmental agreements in existence. Part B of GEO-6 addresses the question: ""How effective have these policy innovations and governance approaches been in addressing the problems and achieving the agreed targets?"" The analysis combines an evaluation of case studies on implemented policies with an indicator-based approach covering a diversity of policy approaches from various levels in the thematic areas of the report, including the following: {10.5,10.7}
❖ Provision of information: for example, access to data on air quality or coral reefs;
❖ Voluntary agreements: for example, voluntary reporting on the use of water, voluntary guidelines for sustainable soil management or standard-setting for best management practice and sustainability reporting;
❖ Economic incentives and market-based instruments: for example, free water allowances, individual transferable quotas for fishers, or payments for ecosystem services;
❖ Planning for the environment: for example, adaptive water management and urban biodiversity management;
❖ Promotion of innovation: for example, innovation for sustainable agriculture or financing for clean cookstoves;
❖ Regulatory approaches: for example, car exhaust emission standards or regulating wildlife trade through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora;
❖ Governance approaches that include communities, and private sector and civil society actors: for example, city actions to limit food waste or to promote community-based conservation.
Indicators for the evaluation include, for example for air, annual mean PM25 concentrations (population-weighted), ozone- depleting substance emissions and long-lived greenhouse gas emissions. The indicators address a wide range of multilateral environmental agreements and Sustainable Development Goals.
There has been innovation in environmental policies and instruments to reduce emissions and resource depletion (well established). There is no single superior approach that addresses the wide variety of barriers to sustainable development and that is applicable in all contexts. A diversity of approaches and innovation in policymaking is justified. {10.3}
Policy design is at least as important as the choice of policy instrument for policy effectiveness (well established). Common elements of good policy design include the following: (i) setting a long-term vision through inclusive, participatory design processes; (ii) establishing a baseline of environmental conditions, quantified science-based targets and milestones; (iii) effectively integrating environmental, social and economic concerns; (iv) conducting ex ante and ex post cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis to ensure that public and private funds are being used with optimal efficiency and effectiveness and that social aspects are being considered in sufficient detail; (v) building-in monitoring regimes during implementation that support adaptive policies, ideally involving affected stakeholders; and (vi) conducting postintervention evaluation of policy outcomes and impacts to close the loop for future policy design improvement. {11.2.3}
In many cases, environmental policymaking does not meet the suggested criteria for effective policies, meaning that it does not reach its full potential (established but incomplete).
For example, in many cases neither ex ante nor ex post cost- effectiveness analysis of policy outcomes has been attempted, making success or failure difficult to evaluate, or clear and measurable targets are missing. {Chapter 18}
Policy innovation increasingly takes place in developing countries (established but incomplete). This includes market- based and regulatory approaches that provide environmental improvements while also meeting access rights for the poor. Examples exist of environmental policy instruments that provide access to natural resources and income for the poor, such as the provision of free water in South Africa and sustainable fisheries policies in Chile. {Chapters 12 to 17}
Environmental policymaking can become more dynamic through scaling-up over time (established but incomplete). Policies are revised and improved, based on experience; for example, by increasing the level of ambition or choosing more effective instruments. However, such ratcheting-up is not applied on a systematic basis. There are few policies which have policy feedback mechanisms built in; hence the potential of temporal dynamics is not fully exploited. In many cases, no baseline of existing environmental conditions, which would be necessary for ex post or ex ante evaluation, is established. {11.2.2}
Policy diffusion between countries is increasingly taking place (well established). Successful policies serve as role models for adoption in other countries when national circumstances, priorities, capabilities and legislation allow for it. Multilateral agreements and policy networks at the subnational level serve as catalysts for policy learning between countries. However, there are indications that policy diffusion takes place more often in the field of voluntary and innovation promotion, while market-based instruments or redistributive policies, such as the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies or regulatory approaches, are less often subject to policy diffusion. {11.2.1}
Multilevel governance is a source for policy innovation (well established) at the international level and multilateral environmental agreements support environmental policymaking at the national level to pursue related policies. Stakeholder participation in all phases of the policy cycle from design to implementation to monitoring and evaluation is crucial. At the subnational level, communities, cities and the private sector are all establishing their own policy approaches, which is also supportive for advancing policies at other levels. {11.4}
An integrated approach is key for effective policies (well established). The integration of environmental concerns into the various sectors of policymaking at all levels, including agriculture, fisheries, tourism, forestry, industry, manufacturing and processing, energy and mining, transport, infrastructure and health, is key for effective protection of the environment.
Social and economic aspects require particular consideration when environmental policy is being developed. Similarly, a gender-integrative approach could support more effective and transformative environmental policies and interventions. {11.3}
There is no consistent consideration of environmental aspects in other sectors. Environmental aspects find consideration In other sectors when demonstrating economic and social co-benefits (established but incomplete). Tools for ex ante assessment can reveal potential co-benefits. For example, ""green investment"" of just 2 per cent of global gross domestic product would deliver long-term growth over the period from 2011 to 2050 that could be at least as high as an optimistic business-as- usual scenario, while minimizing the adverse impact of climate change, water scarcity and the loss of ecosystem services. Although analyses such as strategic environmental assessments, environmental impact assessments and assessments of natural resources are increasingly being carried out, their potential has not yet been fully exploited. Environmental integration is insufficient If there are no benefits to other sectors or If costs are Imposed on Influential groups while benefits are widely dispersed In society (well established). Departments of the environment are often too weak to enforce environmental policy Integration. Effective legal, procedural and Institutional mechanisms for environmental policy Integration are not widely applied or Implemented (well established). {11.3, 11.3.3}
An analysis of policy-related indicators shows that despite considerable innovation and effort in advancing environmental policies, the efforts and effects to date remain insufficient (well established). Existing policies have proven Insufficient to address the backlog of environmental problems, and policy gaps remain In the agenda areas of pollution control, efficiency Improvement and planning for the environment. Besides more ambitious and better-designed policies, urgent action Is needed, as resource depletion and growing emissions have a partially Irreversible Impact on ecosystems, human health and economic costs.
{Chapters 12 to 17}
To pursue the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals and to achieve the internationally agreed environmental goals on pollution control, clean-up and efficiency improvements will not be sufficient (established but incomplete). Instead, transformative change, in the sense of reconfiguration of basic social and production systems and structures, Including their Institutional framework, social practices, cultural norms and values, Is necessary. Transformative change enables and combines visionary, strategic and Integrated policymaking with the enabling of bottom- up social, technological and Institutional Innovation and the systematic use of experience drawn from such experimentation. {Chapter 18}
Successful models of environmental governance should be built upon well-designed policies and their implementation, compliance and enforcement. Such models should pay close attention to early signals from science and society and ensure adequate oversight capacity and Investment In knowledge systems, such as data, Indicators, assessments, policy evaluation and sharing platforms. Greater Investment Is needed In environmental accounting systems to ensure that external costs are addressed and that processes are Incorporated that will Identify possible future risks, opportunities and conflicts. {Chapter 18}
Greater application of the precautionary approach, in accordance with international agreements (where applicable), can reduce environmental risk. Coalitions between government Institutions, businesses and civil society to agree on pathways for tackling societal risks can achieve progress, even In conditions of great uncertainty. Multilevel coordination between local and national policy levels will be Instrumental In accelerating the transition towards sustainable development models. {Chapter 18}


4 Changing the path we are on
4.1 The need for urgent, sustained and inclusive action
Without additional policies, trends in environmental degradation are projected to continue at a rapid rate and the related Sustainable Development Goal targets and internationally agreed environmental goals are not expected to be achieved, including on climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, excess nutrient run-off, land degradation and ocean acidification (well established). Current patterns of consumption, production and inequality are not sustainable, adding to other severe environmental pressures. Many environmental indicators are projected to move in the wrong direction. Projected population growth, urbanization trends and economic development will significantly increase demand for natural resources, such as food, energy and water, towards 2050. Under a business-as-usual scenario, resource efficiency in production and consumption, agricultural yields and nutrient use, water and energy efficiency are projected to increase, thereby partially offsetting demand for key environmental resources. However, such improvements will be inadequate to reduce the pressure on already-stressed environmental systems. {21.3.1–21.3.5}
Indicators related to human development are projected to improve, but trends are insufficient to meet related targets (established but incomplete). Improvements are projected on global hunger, and access to safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and modern energy services, but significant inequality of access remains, and those improvements are not expected to take effect quickly enough for many countries to achieve the related Sustainable Development Goal targets. Preventable environment-related health risk factors are projected to remain prominent in 2030. Related global child mortality is projected to decrease, but not sufficiently for many developing countries to achieve the related Development Goal target, in particular in sub- Saharan Africa. Furthermore, air pollution is expected to continue to contribute to millions of premature deaths in the coming decades. {21.3.2, 21.3.3, 21.3.4, 21.3.6}
Overall, the world is not on track to achieve the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and internationally agreed environmental goals by 2050. Urgent action is now needed to reverse those trends and restore both environmental and human health to the planet (established but incomplete). Future projections show that development is either too slow to achieve the targets or even that it moves in the wrong direction (see figure SPM.8). Continuing failure to take urgent action is leading to ongoing and further potentially irreversible adverse impact, including on critical environmental resources and human health. {Section 2.2} Current patterns of consumption and production may be more expensive in the long term for many countries, as it often costs more to clean up later than it does to prevent damage now, added to which cleaning up later may not always be possible. For example, a further delay in climate action increases the cost of achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, and at some point will make it impossible to achieve them.
{21.3.3, 21.4, 24.4}
4.2 Transformative change and an integrated approach are needed
Pathways exist that show that the healthy planet needed for sustainable development can be achieved (established but incomplete). The literature includes many scenarios that provide information on the ways in which the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements and related internationally agreed environmental goals can be achieved.
Those pathways emphasize a number of key transitions in moving towards a healthy planet. They are associated with achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns for energy, food and water in order to provide universal access to those resources, while preventing climate change, air pollution, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity, and overexploitation and pollution of oceans. They include changes in lifestyle, consumption preferences and consumer behaviour on the one hand, and cleaner production processes, resource efficiency and decoupling, corporate responsibility and compliance on the other hand. {22.3}
Transformative changes are needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements and related internationally agreed environmental goals. They go beyond what can be achieved by environmental policies alone (established but incomplete). The rate of change in the pathways indicates that incremental environmental policies alone will not suffice. A mix of social and technological improvements and innovations is required, facilitated by effective policy measures and cooperation on a scale from the local to the international. {22.4.1}
Meeting the targets related to climate change, reducing air pollution and providing sustainable energy for all is possible. Measures can be combined in different ways but need to be implemented rapidly and at an unprecedented scale (well established). It involves investment in energy access, enhancing the development and implementation of energy-efficiency improvements, lifestyle changes, a more rapid introduction of low greenhouse gas-emission technologies (including sustainable and eguitably-produced bioenergy, hydropower, solar, wind and carbon-capture-and-storage), air pollution control and reducing emissions and increasing removals from land use and land-use change and forestry of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (including non-C02 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture). Pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement are characterized by a reduction of carbon intensity in the global economy of 4 to 6 per cent per annum between now and 2050 (compared with 1 to 2 per cent per annum historically), which would reduce energy system greenhouse gas emissions to almost zero by 2050. {22.3.2}
Eliminating hunger, preventing biodiversity loss and halting land degradation is possible by combining measures related to consumption, production, waste and redistribution of food, and nature conservation policies (established but incomplete). Scenarios achieving those social and environmental targets are typically characterized by a 50 per cent faster improvement in agricultural yields than a business-as-usual scenario, but depend heavily on changes on the consumption side and improvements in food distribution. Plaiting biodiversity loss would also require measures related to landscape management and protected areas. Ecological infrastructure can buffer farmers and rural and urban communities against climate shocks such as droughts and floods, mitigate water pollution and increase water supply, while at the same time protecting biodiversity. Sustainable agriculture also requires a reduction in the nitrogen and phosphorus imbalance to reduce pollution of freshwater systems, groundwater and coastal zones in oceans. Reducing water scarcity requires more efficient water use, increasing water storage and investing in desalination. Ambitious scenarios in the literature typically show higher water- use efficiency rates than in business-as-usual scenarios, but still fail to reach full water security. {22.3.1,22.3.3, 22.3.4}
Synergies exist between specific measures and a broad range of sustainability targets, including measures related to education, promoting sustainable consumption, specifically a healthy diet and reducing air pollution (well established). Improved education, especially for women and girls, has a particularly strong connection with health outcomes, economic growth, reduced poverty and better environmental management. Meat products require more land than crops (see figure SPM.4). Therefore, promoting sustainable and healthy diets, reducing food waste in both developing and developed countries, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices would contribute towards meeting the nutritional needs of the 9-10 billion people projected to be on the planet in 2050. In doing so, synergies could be realized between improving health and nutrition, while reducing biodiversity loss, advancing habitat restoration and preventing land degradation and water scarcity. Phasing out the use of fossil fuels and moving towards lower-carbon-emission fuels, including sustainable bioenergy, would lead to important cobenefits, achieving both climate and air-quality targets, the latter also having synergies with improving human health, increasing agricultural production and reducing biodiversity loss. {22.4.2}
There are also potential trade-offs between achieving different sustainability targets. Land-based climate change mitigation, namely bioenergy crop production, and agricultural intensification are key measures for achieving climate and food targets respectively, but could have significant detrimental effects on other environmental targets if not managed carefully (well established). While nearly all scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement rely on land-based mitigation measures, their use increases demand for land and could thus have a potentially massive influence on land-use patterns and eventually lead to higher food prices, which would in turn affect food security. Increasing agricultural yields would improve overall food availability and reduce pressure on natural land. Applying unsustainable agriculture practices could lead to land degradation, hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, biodiversity loss and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. {22.4.2}

Understanding the interlinkage between measures and targets is crucial for synergistic implementation and policy coherence
(well established). Integrated approaches would enable synergies to be grasped and potential trade-offs to be dealt with so that environmental targets could be achieved simultaneously. {22.4.2}
4.3 Innovation for systemic transformation to achieve environmental goals
Coordinated and ambitious policy coupled with social and technological innovation, could enable the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, related multilateral environmental agreements and internationally agreed environmental goals (established, but incomplete). Transformative pathways to sustainable development reguire the following:
(i) vision to guide systemic innovation towards sustainability;
(ii) social and policy innovation; (iii) phasing-out of unsustainable practices; (iv) policy experimentation; and (v) engaging and enabling diverse actors, including local and indigenous people. Integrated approaches can help to deal with the synergies and potential trade-offs between the various policies and measures.
A vision for sustainable development and leadership can energize popular support. Examples of integrated policies for achieving sustainability goals include providing economic incentives, including the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies, improving price structures and introducing taxes to internalize social and environmental costs. {24.3}
Transformative projects and innovative solutions exist that could collectively help in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the aims of multilateral environmental agreements and internationally agreed environmental goals (unresolved). Social, policy and technological innovation is needed. At the local level, many transformative projects and innovative solutions already exist that could be scaled appropriately. Reviewing bottom-up initiatives reveals ideas, actions and programmes that seek to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and involve a wide range of public and private stakeholders, including the following: (i) nature-based solutions, including those that draw on indigenous knowledge, such as ecological infrastructure and ecological restoration; (ii) monitoring and reporting innovations, including Earth observation systems, for better information on environmental conditions, citizen science initiatives that involve citizens in environmental monitoring and which involve decentralization of technologies to educate and engage citizens (for example, web applications that allow citizens to monitor water quality and report problems to relevant government agencies), and natural capital accounting that integrates economic, social and environmental components;
(iii) circular and sharing economy innovations that involve the increased efficiency of resource use, specifically through new business models that better engage with waste products of other production processes and innovations related to the peer-to-peer sharing of goods and services; (iv) innovations and policies that help to reduce toxic substances and solid waste, including plastic waste; (v) improving public awareness and building relevant skills through sustainability and environmental education; (vi) an emphasis on gender equality, the empowerment of women and solutions that promote the fair treatment of all, from the local level to the global arena; and (vii) smart, sustainable cities that, for example, use modern digital technologies to engage and connect with citizens in addressing key sustainability challenges for cities, such as transportation, consumption patterns, energy, nutrition, water and waste management. {17.7, 23.11.1}

Financial investment and engagement of individuals, businesses and other non-governmental stakeholders are critical to the achievement of this agenda (established, but incomplete). Unsustainable products and industrial processes could be phased out by introducing the following: (i) new regulatory mechanisms setting standards (for example, securing land tenure rights); (ii) financial mechanisms to boost sustainability investment (for example, on rural electrification), improve chemical use efficiency and minimize harmful chemicals, and to account for both market and non-market risks and impact;
(iii) environmental education and education for sustainable development to enhance awareness and competencies for sustainability-driven consumer choices, entrepreneurship, greater corporate social responsibility and promoting viable business models; (iv) exploration and promotion of pathways that provide opportunities for all stakeholders to participate in a well-being economy; (v) overcoming the inertia of existing unsustainable technologies and vested interests and (vi) economic instruments that set a price on pollution. {23.11,24.3}
Transformative change requires adaptive policy, the creation of an enabling environment for niche innovations and the removal of barriers to change (established, but incomplete). Political, institutional and lifestyle changes can enable a sustainable and inclusive transition to environmental sustainability. Local- scale policy experiments provide space for policy tailoring and innovation that is closely monitored, and also allow for the inclusion of systems of local and indigenous knowledge for improved environmental management. Redress for environmental degradation through legal mechanisms such as access to courts and justice also provide an important mechanism for ensuring inclusive access to a clean and healthy environment for all. {23.11,24.2}
Participatory approaches can help decision-makers and non-State actors to identify and pursue innovative solutions towards sustainability (established but incomplete). Participatory and grassroots approaches could provide a useful set of initiatives and aspirational visions, pathways and solutions from stakeholders to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and multilateral environmental agreements. That includes inclusive innovation, in which power and decision-making is relatively decentralized and externalities are internalized. Furthermore, such approaches can highlight gaps and blind spots in distributional equity, responsibility and capacity to address global environmental problems and their solutions. Participatory approaches can help to deliver context-relevant solutions. For example, decentralized renewable energy and microgrids fit neatly into many bottom-up sustainable visions that challenge traditionally modelled large- scale, centralized energy transitions. Accounting for regional differences, gender and other demographics are important for assessing and addressing problems, including the need for disaggregated data. Sustainable Development Goal policy design and implementation requires alignment of the collective wellbeing of actors from the local to other levels, taking into account in particular the needs of the vulnerable and most marginalized in society. Information and communications technology can drive change, if risks such as privacy are minimized. {23.9.2, 23.14, 24.3.5}
Strengthened international cooperation, including support to least developed countries, is needed to tackle this agenda (well established). International cooperation and support, coupled with financial commitment and international funding, are critical If this agenda Is to be achieved. Effective governance solutions to improve multilevel and multi-country cooperation and harmonization across scales include improved management of interdependencies to reduce Interregional inequalities. Bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral environmental treaties are important governance mechanisms for achieving inclusive and sustainable development across knowledge systems. {11.4,19.1,23, 14}
4.4 The benefits that will result from following more sustainable future pathways
Investments in policies that address environmental issues promote human health and well-being, prosperity and resilient societies (well established). Mobilizing financial resources for sustainable development Is necessary to resolve environmental problems and ensure environmental protection, especially In developing countries. Sustainable future pathways are intended to create a ""healthy planet, healthy people"". A healthy planet will result In people who live longer, healthier lives: nearly one quarter of all deaths globally in 2012 could be attributed to modifiable environmental risks, with a greater portion occurring in populations In a vulnerable situation and in developing countries. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets on hunger, access to safe drinking water and sanitation and modern energy services could reduce deaths in children under 5 related to malnutrition, diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections by more than 400,000 per year by 2030. Furthermore, air pollution is the largest environmental health risk and is projected to continue to have significant negative effects on health, with scenario studies estimating between 4.5 million and 7 million premature deaths by mid-century under a business-as-usual scenario. Combined climate and air pollution policies could reduce those numbers significantly. {5.4.1, 21.3.3, 21.3.6, 22.3.2, 22.3.5, 23.12, 24.4}
Improved health outcomes have significant economic benefits (through a larger and healthier labour force), as well as demographic implications (established but incomplete). The health co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants can outweigh the costs of mitigation. For example, global health savings for reaching a 2 degrees Celsius target are estimated to be approximately US$54 trillion, compared with global policy costs of approximately US$22 trillion. Decreased child and maternal mortality, especially when combined with female education and access to sexual and reproductive health services, Including modern contraception, is likely to lead to lower fertility rates in the longer term, curbing population growth, one of the major drivers of environmental degradation, thus highlighting the fact that healthy people can also support a healthy planet. {2.3, 22.3.5, 24.4}

5. Knowledge for action



5.1 Improved data and greater knowledge enable better and more effective actions and solutions in more places
Though actions must be undertaken on the basis of the knowledge already at hand, the world needs openly accessible data, information, analysis, knowledge and science to better inform and guide what needs to be done to achieve sustainability across all environmental dimensions (established but incomplete). Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements, internationally agreed environmental goals and science-based targets will require an integrated approach that considers linkage across different environmental and non-environmental components, building upon disaggregated data generation and incorporating traditional knowledge and citizen science. Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets needs to be followed up upon and reviewed, using the global indicators, complemented by indicators at the national and regional levels, and work is needed to develop the baselines for those targets for which national and global baseline data do not yet exist. Integrated data and analysis can prioritize needs, shape effective policies and strengthen monitoring and evaluation outcomes. {3.1,25.1}
Advances in collecting official statistics and other evidence that feed into geographic information systems for environmental monitoring and accounting have expanded knowledge, while highlighting data gaps in every environmental domain (well established). Such gaps limit our capacity to formulate and implement policy solutions. More data will assist in linking people with the environment. Time series data is vitally important in that regard, as it forms the basis for monitoring change. Regular standardized data collection can be translated into statistics and indicators that highlight vulnerabilities within and between communities. Disaggregated data that captures information by gender, ethnicity, race, income, age and geographic region identify critical differences and promote effective policy design. {3.5, 3.7}
In addition to filling knowledge gaps with new data, enormous gains can be made from consolidating, curating, harmonizing and increasing open access to existing data which are widely dispersed and cannot be easily combined or compared (well established). Common frameworks, initiatives and political will are needed to merge data sources and make better use of what is available. In that context, the Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting and the System of National Accounts are robust consensus statistical frameworks and methodological approaches that could be broadly adopted (see figure SPM.9). Rationalizing both existing and newly collected data is essential for the development of indicators. {3.3}
Whether an indicator can be measured by Earth observation is a major factor in data availability (well established). A revolution in the quality and cost-effectiveness of Earth observation data means that indicators that can be measured remotely have far greater spatial coverage than those that cannot. For example, satellites can estimate deforestation and land use change with increasing accuracy, but cannot monitor all aspects of subsurface ocean environments. Data are particularly sparse for biodiversity, which is measured mostly by in situ observation and genetic analysis. Some freshwater components, such as groundwater and water use, are also data-deficient due to measurement challenges. The dichotomy in the volume of remotely sensed data versus in situ data will Inevitably grow as Earth observation technologies improve. {3.4}
More inclusive and open access to data will assist in achieving equity, transparency and best use of data for sustainability and development (established but incomplete). The ""open data"" movement has gained significant traction in recent years, working towards data being freely available to all. Education is a key component of access and countries should be forward-thinking in building capacity to analyse and Interpret environmental data. For many measures, there is a strong Imbalance In data access between developed and developing countries. That contributes to global differences In the ability of nations to understand the environment, its Implications for human health and the use of environmental data for socioeconomic gain. {25.2.2}
5.2 Opportunities from emerging data sources and the Earth-human systems modelling revolution
Emerging data sources, such as Earth observation and Earth-human systems models, when combined with socioeconomic data and contextual analysis, can enable better policy decisions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and multilateral environmental agreements (established but incomplete). ""Big data"", generated through new approaches and technologies, is emerging as a valuable resource which can Inform environmental assessment processes. Evolving artificial intelligence and technological analytics, including algorithms, programming and mechanical methods, can advance evidence-based Information for decision-making, forming part of what some refer to as the ""fourth Industrial revolution"". There is enormous potential for advancing environmental knowledge if big data can be effectively harnessed and Interrogated. Stronger collaboration between the public and private sectors, especially large corporations involved In big data collection, are critical for promoting economically viable and equitable solutions. Protocols for big data use are continually being developed and refined, but the extreme pace at which big data Is evolving creates the potential for misinterpretation and misuse, raising Issues of ethics, privacy and protection, for which urgent policy attention Is required. {25.1.2}
Future sensor technology should allow detailed data disaggregation of spatial and demographic information
(established but incomplete). A combination of satellites and airborne and ground-based networks can help to monitor developments and Impact at the local, regional and global levels in near-real time. The resulting data and Information, together with rapidly emerging digital infrastructure, can enable rapid response to changing circumstances. Realizing those benefits, however, depends on appropriate governance and national circumstances for data collection, processing, curation and use, along with combining environmental data with context-relevant socioeconomic information. {25.1.2}

While Earth observation is the primary contributor to remotely-sensed big data, citizen science enables timely, cost-effective collation of in situ data from dispersed sources
(well established). When coupled with emerging technologies, such as smart sensors, mobile devices and web applications, citizen science enables the collection and analysis of large volumes of geographically-referenced data to Inform and support decision-making, educate the public about environmental issues and enhance public participation. There are, however, significant challenges in ensuring that citizen science data are of appropriate quality, representative, can be soundly analysed and that results are effectively disseminated. {25.1.1}
Traditional knowledge is a globally underutilized resource which can complement science-based knowledge (well established). In 2007, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples helped indigenous peoples to document, revive and strengthen their knowledge, but capacity-building Is needed to develop practices for managing the collection of information and the Integration of traditional knowledge with other knowledge systems. Collaborative work between traditional knowledge holders, academia and Governments has led to Innovative processes, procedures and tools for data generation, and knowledge production and enrichment, which can help In understanding and caring for the environment. {25.1.3}
Importantly, data gaps will be an ongoing reality for the foreseeable future and should not delay urgent action (well established). Decision-makers at all levels cannot wait for new data before acting, but should Implement evidence-based management from current knowledge, then be adaptive and responsive as new knowledge becomes available. Governments and society need to embrace the evolving data landscape, facilitate the development of new Information technology skills and adopt a holistic approach In utilizing both existing and emerging data and knowledge tools. {25.2.4}
International cooperation and sharing of data and information resulting from observational networks on Earth and in space are key to success (well established). Continued Investment in education and training of the next generation of experts and decision-makers Is essential for maintaining the pace of progress on the multigenerational challenges associated with the ""Healthy Planet, Healthy People"" theme of GEO-6. {25.3}
5.3 The way forward
The sixth Global Environmental Outlook has set out many of the challenges and opportunities faced by the world today, moving forward from today to 2030 and beyond that to 2050.
The ongoing revolution In data and knowledge of all types at the local, national and multinational levels offers an opportunity to Increase our capacity to address environmental and governance challenges and accelerate progress. Most Important Is the need to take bold, urgent, sustainable and inclusive action that Integrates environmental, economic and social activity on pathways to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements, Internationally agreed environmental goals and other science-based targets."
